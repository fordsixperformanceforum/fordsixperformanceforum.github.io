            <p align="justify"><strong>              What is meant by Degreeing the Camshaft,   and why is it necessary?</strong> <br />
              <br />
              The phrase &quot;Degreeing the Cam&quot; means   you are making sure the camshaft's position in the engine coincides with that of   the crankshaft, so that their rotations are synchronized. This is the only way you   will know if the rise and fall of the pistons properly matches the opening and   closing of the valves, so the engine runs efficiently. A few degrees of   misalignment (advanced or retarded) can affect the engine's operation dramatically. <br />
              <br />
            If the   circumstances were perfect, one would only need to line up the marks on the   timing chain sprockets and the cam would be degree'd. In reality, you are dealing   with a group of components (the camshaft, crankshaft, timing chain, and   sprockets), all with their own standards and tolerances. If these tolerances   are off, they can stack up against you and  throw your motor out of synchronization. Without degreeing the   cam, you can never be sure if all the parts are in correct position at the precise time they  are suppose to be. As such, we always recommend that you &quot;degree the camshaft&quot; whenever possible, even if you have to rent or borrow the tools. Be sure to read our tech article on<a href="CamInstall.html"> Camshaft Installation Tips. </a></p>

              </tr>
            </table>
            <p align="justify"><strong>There are two  ways to degree a cam, so   which is better?</strong> <br />
              <br />
              Currently there are two popular methods for   degreeing a cam: the <strong>centerline <span class="style3B">method</span></strong>, and the <strong>duration at .050&quot;<span class="style3B">   method</span></strong>. We believe it is far better to degree the camshaft with either   method, than not to degree the cam at all. While  the <strong>duration at .050&quot; <span class="style3B">method</span> <span class="style3B">is  more accurate</span></strong>, the <strong>centerline <span class="style3B">method</span></strong> is easier and has less chance for errors. For your average street application, the  <strong>centerline <span class="style3B">method</span></strong> is adequate, while the <strong>duration @.050&quot;<span class="style3B"> method</span></strong> is preferred if you are building for maximum horsepower. <br />
              <br />
              The main problem   with the <strong>centerline</strong> method is it has you finding the theoretical centerline of   the intake and/or exhaust lobe and lining up on it. It makes the basic assumption   that the cam lobes are symmetrical, with the opening side of the lobe being the   exact same shape and size as the closing side. The truth is that   most  lobes are asymmetrical, with the opening side of the lobe being much more aggressive and the closing side more gentle.
              Therefore, when   you attempt to locate the  centerline of an asymmetrical lobe, there   is an automatic error factor which  could be off 2 degrees or more. Since the duration at .050&quot; lift method is not affected by the asymmetrical   lobe design, it is more accurate and the best way to degree the cam if you are seeking every ounce of power you can get from your motor. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>A simple explanation, </strong><span class="style4B">using the C<strong>enterline</strong> method. </span></p>
            <p align="justify">A camshaft is ground with a predetermined  distance between the intake   and exhaust lobes. This distance is determined by the cam   designer and is known as the camshaft's &quot;lobe center&quot;, which is usually between 104-114 degrees. This would be 208-228 degrees at the crank, since the crankshaft turns twice for every revolution of the camshaft. Using the centerline method, readings are taken at a predetermined distance before and after top dead center. These readings are then split,  giving you the camshafts  centerline. The cam is then adjusted so that the  centerline is an equal distance between these two points on the   degree wheel.   However if it is desirable to advance the camshaft one would merely move the   centerline of the intake lobe closer to T.D.C. This is explained in greater detail below. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>A simple explanation, </strong><span class="style4B">using the Duration at .050 method. </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="style3B">Using the</span><span class="style4B"> Duration at .050 method, </span>you  start on the base circle of the lobe where there is no lift. Then by rotating the engine you  move up the opening   side, go over the top of the lobe, then move down the closing side, finishing   back on the base circle. 
              The dial indicator will move from zero, up to   maximum lobe lift, then back to zero during this revolution. When rotating the crankshaft you stop at two key points  and take readings from the degree   wheel. Both readings are taken when the dial indicator shows .050&quot; of lifter rise, which  occur on the opening side and again on the closing side   of the lobe. These readings are then  compared to the specifications on the cam card to   see how closely the cam is installed to the proper alignment.  If necessary, corrections can be made to put the camshaft   in the exact position that is intended by the cam manufacturer. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Correcting or adjusting the cams location.</strong> <br />
              <br />
There are several methods you can use to adjust the   location of the camshaft to correct for misalignment. Most high performance   timing chain sets have the lower crank sprocket machined with three or more   keyways, allowing you to advance or retard the camshaft. There are also offset   keys made for the crankshaft. Another popular method is offset eccentric timing   bushings that can be installed in the upper camshaft sprocket to change the   camshaft's position in relation to the sprocket, however this is only on camshafts that use a   dowel pin for indexing. Use any of these methods to correct the position of the cam, then degree the camshaft once   more, to be sure it is correct.</p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Important tips to remember when &quot;Degreeing a Cam&quot;.</strong> <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style3B"><strong class="style3B">Clean off any excessive lubricant</strong> from the lobes and lifters that you are checking. Thick oil, especially assembly   lube (paste) c</span>an cause false readings to occur. Wipe the parts clean before   checking, and remember to re-lubricate them when you are finished. <br />
              <br />
              
            If   you make a mistake and rotate the engine past the point you wished to take a   reading,<strong> do not back up the rotation</strong>. If you do, any slack in the timing   chain or lash in the gears will affect the readings, causing an error. If you   miss your stopping point, just continue rotating the engine in the normal   direction until you return to the desired point.<br />
            <br />
            Make sure the angle of the dial indicator plunger is at the same angle as, or parallel  to, the valve stem. You want to read &quot;straight line&quot; (linear)   movement of these parts, so the plunger must be  properly aligned.<br />
            <br />
            <strong>What   tools are need to Degree the Cam?</strong> </p>
            <p align="justify">Beyond your normal everyday hand tools, you'll need a few special tools, as follows:</p>
            <p align="justify">              1. A degree wheel,  a professional fully degreed damper, or  a piece of degree tape   which is installed on  your stock damper. Be sure to get the tape that matches the diameter of the   damper. Whatever you use, just make sure it gives you accurate markings for 360 degrees. <br />
              <br />
              2. A   stable pointer that can be mounted to the engine, so that it points to the degree wheel or balancer markings. <br />
              <br />
              3. A dial   indicator with at least a half inch of travel in .001&quot; increments, with a rigid stand   that attaches to the engine, preferably with a magnetic base or bolts. <br />
              <br />
              4. A positive piston stop, which can be used to locate T.D.C. (top dead center). You   can make your own by using an old spark plug. Simply remove the porcelain insides, then   drill and tap the interior of the spark plug housing and thread a long bolt   through it. </p>
            <p align="justify">5. At least one solid lifter (preferably two).  If you have non-adjustable rockers,  you'll also need at least one  adjustable pushrod (preferably two). You can get by with one of each, but it's nice to have two, one for the intake and for the exhaust. <br />
                <br />
            All of the above tools, with the exception of an adjustable pushrod, are in our <a href="proddetail3773.html?prod=CSC%2DDEG%2DKIT">Cam Degree Kits</a>. We also offer a <a href="proddetailc9d7.html?prod=CSC%2DVIDEO&amp;cat=76">Cam Degree Video</a>, which explains both methods and walks you thru the process, step by step.

            <p align="justify">Before you begin the set-up procedure,  install the camshaft and timing chain set with the dots lined up as you normally would. Be sure to read our <a href="CamInstall.html"> Camshaft Installation Tips. </a>Install solid lifters, and pushrods, for both the intake and exhaust valves in the number one cylinder only. It is not necessary to install the rest of the lifters or pushrods. If you have non-adjustable rocker arms, use an adjustable pushrod. Once the rocker arms are installed, set the valve lash to zero, leaving the pushrods loose enough so that you can easily spin them with your fingertips.  DO NOT preload the lifters. Rotate the crankshaft, so that both the intake and exhaust valve are closed and the piston is  at the top of the stroke (approximately at top dead center). This can be a rough guess, but it may save you from making a mistake later on. <br />
            <br />The first step, using  either method, is to install a degree wheel, a pointer, and a positive piston stop, which is used to locate  Top Dead Center (TDC). First, attach the degree wheel to the balancer, making sure you can rotate the crankshaft once it is installed. Next, mount the pointer securely on the engine block, adjusting it so that it points to the zero on the degree wheel.  A steel coat hanger works nicely, as it can be easily bent to any shape. The last step is to install  the piston stop in the number one cylinder. Start by turning the crankshaft in the opposite direction (counter-clockwise)15-20 degrees, then turn the piston stop in until it touches the top of the piston. This will ensure  the piston  stops before reaching TDC. Then back it off the stop another 10-15 degrees. </p>
            <p align="justify" class="style4B">Determining Top Dead Center (TDC) </p>
            <p align="justify">Begin by rotating the crankshaft by hand in a clockwise direction, until the piston comes up and stops   against the piston stop. <strong>DO NOT use the starter or you may damage the piston. </strong>Look at the degree wheel and write down the number of degrees   shown by the pointer. Next hand turn the engine in the opposite direction   until the piston comes up and once again stops. Look at the degree wheel once more and write down the degrees it  now reads. Add this reading to the first reading    and divide the answer by two. By splitting the difference, the resulting answer will give you the point of TDC.  Move  the pointer so that it  points to that number. Next loosen the degree wheel and turn it until the pointer indicates zero, then re-tighten the bolts. Make certain you do not disturb the position of the   crankshaft or the pointer when you are turning the degree wheel. 
              Rotate the engine again, first in one direction, then in the other direction, making  note of the readings when the piston stops  in both directions. If  both readings, on each side of zero (TDC), are   an equal distance (in degrees) away from the zero, the degree wheel is properly adjusted and   the zero mark  now   represents true TDC. At this point the piston  stop can be remove, however if you are unsure or have any doubts, repeat the process. Locating TDC is CRITICAL if you are to Degree the Cam successfully. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong class="style4B">Finding TDC on your harmonic balancer.</strong></p>
            <p align="justify"> Even   without a degree wheel, you can and  should calibrate  TDC on   your harmonic balancer when building or assembling a new engine. By using the steps above you can scribe a mark on the harmonic balancer. Each time you contact the positive stop, rotating both forward and   backward, scribe a mark inline with the factory pointer on the timing cover. TDC will be   exactly between the two scribed stop marks. Carefully calculate and scribe a   permanent TDC marker between these two stop marks. This can be very useful later on, as TDC   is the  point from which all ignition and valve timing   is based.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="style4B">Setting the Dial Indicator. </p>
            <p align="justify">The next step is to install the dial indicator. While we recommend setting the dial indicator so that the readings are taken off the valve retainer, there is some controversy in this method. Many cam manufacturers recommend taking the reading from the top of the lifter, however this is a bit impractical for our inline sixes as the lifters sit deep in the lifter galley. On the other hand, some cam manufactures recommend using the valve retainer for taking readings, since it compensates for pushrod and rocker arm deflection,  reduces errors, and is easier to set up. </p>
            <p align="justify">The dial indicator and stand must be attached   securely to the engine, as any deflection will cause an error in your readings.   It is   very important to make sure that the angle of the dial indicator plunger is  the same angle (parallel) to the valve stem.  With the   dial indicator in position,  hand rotate the engine in a   clockwise direction (when standing in front of the engine) until the   intake valve is fully closed, then set the dial indicator to zero. The lifter is now on the base circle of the cam lobe. </p>
            <p align="justify">Once these steps have been properly completed, the degree wheel will be set so that it reads zero when the number one cylinder is at Top Dead Center, and  the dial indicator  reads zero when the intake valve is fully closed. You are now ready to &quot;Degree the Cam&quot;, using either of the following methods. </p>

            </table>
            <p align="justify">The centerline method does not require any special setup, but it   does require some simple math, so you may want a calculator. Begin by rotating the   engine clockwise until the dial indicator reads max lift. Set the dial   indicator to zero and rotate the engine counterclockwise until the dial indicator reads   roughly 0.100 inch down from max lift. This is done to take out any slack that may be present in the timing chain. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Note:</strong> You always want to hit your points by spinning the crank in the same direction   it will rotate when the engine is running, which removes any variances created by   slack in the timing chain. If your rings provide a lot of friction, it can be   easy to go too far. If so, back up and try again. Just do not set the dial to   0.050 by turning the crank counterclockwise.<br />
              <br />
              Continue by slowly rotating the engine clockwise until   the dial indicator reads 0.050 inch before maximum lift (or zero) and record the number on the   degree wheel. Next, continue to rotate the crankshaft clockwise through maximum lift (past zero) and onward until the dial   indicator reads 0.050 inch after maximum lift (this is the closing side of the intake lobe), and again record the number on the   degree wheel. Next, add  those two numbers together and divide by two. The resulting number will be the location of maximum lift in relation to the crankshaft, which is  known as  the <strong>camshafts intake   centerline</strong>. This number should be the same as the camshafts lobe center if the cam was ground straight up. If the numbers match, the cam is installed properly. If not, adjust the cam accordingly, either by advancing or retarding the camshaft. </p>
            <p align="justify"><strong>Note:</strong> Many manufacturers, such as Comp Cams, grind their camshafts with 4 degrees of advance automatically added in. Clay Smith however, grinds their cams straight up, without any advance added in. If you prefer more bottom end power, we recommend installing your Clay Smith cam with 4 degrees  of advance. In other words, if the cams lobe center is 110 degrees, you would install the  cam with a centerline of 106 degrees.  Or if the cams lobe center is 112 degrees, you would install the  cam with a centerline of 108 degrees.<br />
              <br /> 
            However, when you install a cam with advanced valve timing, you almost always lose a little top end power. If you do a lot of highway driving, and more top end power is desired rather than bottom end torque,  you may choose  to install the cam straight up. You can also  make a compromise and install it with  2 degrees of advance. While the choice is totally up to you, Classic Inlines recommends installing the cam with 4 degrees of advance for most street or street/strip  applications. </p>

            <p align="justify"> Rotate   the engine in its normal direction of rotation while watching the dial   indicator. As the lifter starts to move up the opening side of the lobe, the   reading on the dial indicator will start to increase. Continue rotating the   engine until the dial indicator shows .050&quot; of rise. Stop and take a reading on   the degree wheel and write it down. <br />
              <br />
              As you continue to rotate the   engine, the reading on the dial indicator will rise up to the maximum lobe lift.   The lifter is now on the top of the lobe. The maximum lobe lift is often shown on the   spec card and can be verified at this point if you wish. Continue the rotation   and the lifter will start down the closing side of the lobe. Carefully watch the   dial indicator as the numbers descend. When the indicator descends back to the   .050&quot; reading, stop and take another reading from the degree wheel and write it down.   Then rotate the engine and return to the base circle of the lobe. <span class="style3B">The dial   indicator must read zero  again, to be sure the process was correctly done. </span><br />
              <br />
              You now have the two important readings from the degree wheel, both   taken when the dial indicator read .050&quot;, one BTDC and the other ATDC. One reading as the indicator was   ascending on the opening side (BTDC), the other when it was descending on the closing   side (ATDC). Compare these numbers to those on your cam card to verify   the position of the intake lobe. The cam card will show the degree readings    for the intake &quot;opening&quot; side of the lobe and the intake &quot;closing&quot; side of the   lobe, when the dial indicator is at .050&quot; of lift. Compare your readings for the   intake to those on the card. If you're within a degree, your camshaft is   installed in the correct position. <br />
              <br />
            You can follow exactly the same   procedure on the exhaust lobe to determine its opening and closing  points   at .050&quot; of lifter rise, and compare the readings to those on the   cam  card. By checking the exhaust lobe, you will have four points   of reference (intake opening and closing, and exhaust opening and closing)   to go by. Remember, if you are plus or minus one degree of these readings, your   cam installed properly and will be synchronized to the crankshaft's   rotation. <br />
