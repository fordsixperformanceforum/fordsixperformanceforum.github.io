          <td width="100%" height="489" colspan="2"><p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style3Bl"></span> In the coming months we will be adding a lot of information on Weber carbs, concentrating  most of our efforts on the Progressive  DGV, DFV, and DGS downdraft carbs. This article was complied from numerous articles and resources found on the internet, as well as our own experiences. The purpose of this guide is to cover the basics things you'll need to know to make your Weber carburetor run properly.&nbsp; This is accomplished by setting the adjustments properly, and by re-jetting the carb so it meets the requirements of your specific engine. It's really pretty simple and not nearly as intimidating as you might think.  For more detailed information, please refer to the  &ldquo;Weber Factory Tuning Manual&rdquo;  published by <strong>Haynes</strong>. <br />
              <br />
            In a few weeks, we will be offering a tuning kit that will include several jet sizes, emulsion tubes, air bleeds and/or corrector jets. A deposit will be required, which is refundable when the kit is returned in good condition (minus the cost of any parts that are used, missing, or damaged). If you can afford to buy one, an A/F Ratio Gauge is an invaluable tool for tuning your carburetor, but it's generally too expensive ($500) for most customers, especially when you consider it's only use once or twice. For those that can't you need to learn how to read spark plugs, as this will get the job done. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style3B">The secret&nbsp; to    understanding the critical nature of the carb set up, and the advantages of   a Weber over other carburetors, is the Idle circuit. Referred to as the low speed   circuit by Weber, this circuit is responsible for 80% of the driving operation.   This is the reason that the Weber should give an improvement in fuel economy over   most factory carbs, along with significant performance gains. In a worst case scenario,   you should'nt see a significant loss in fuel economy, but you should experience an improvement in  power &amp; driveability.</span><br />
              <br />
              If your engine isn't running at it's peak potential, you may  need to make a few adjustments to the carb. However there's a few things you  should do before you start tearing into the carb.  Remember.... a Weber  carb is a performance upgrade, which was designed to deliver more fuel and air,  and to make more HP over the stock carb. However... you need to make sure your  fuel system supplies an adequate amount of fuel, at the proper pressure. You also need to make sure your ignition system is working properly, that the distributor was designed to work with a Weber carb (such as a Durasprk or DUI), and that it is capable of supplying  an adequate spark  to burn the extra fuel. Stock points style distributors are not up to the task, and need to be replace with a  electronic distributor, an ignition box, and a hotter coil. Good plug wires are also required. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Vacuum Leaks </strong><br />
              Let's back up just a bit..... before you go digging into your fuel system and the ignition, the first  thing you need to do is check for vacuum leaks. Vacuum leaks are the #1 problem with  carb swaps and conversions. This is particularly true of newer installs, as the chances of having a defective carb out of the box, are  about the same as being struck by lightning. The first thing to check is the gaskets between the manifold, the adaptor, and the carb. In most cases we recommend using Silicone Gasket Maker between the manifold and the carb adaptor, since the adaptor never needs to be removed once it has been installed. This will greatly reduce the chances of a vacuum leak at that point. Next, we highly recommend a gasket  between the adaptor and  carb, so the carb can be easily removed for maintenance and tunning whenever  needed. Make sure you use a new gasket, not an old one that may leak. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Fuel Delivery &amp; Electric Fuel Pumps <br />
                  <span class="style3B">Make sure that your  fuel delivery is right. You cannot tune carbs that do not have  adequate and proper fuel delivery, as it is critical to the proper  performance of any Weber carb. From your basic 32/36 DGV to a set of triple  side-draft carbs, all Weber carbs rely on a stable and full float bowl in order to  mix the fuel and air correctly. Mechanical pumps very rarely do this. They  pulse fuel instead of giving a smooth even delivery, and the amount of fuel  varies with engine RPM.<br />
                  <br />
A good electric fuel pump will provide the best performance and a stable supply of fuel for tuning your Weber carb. It should be noted that Weber carbs work best at 4 psi, not 2 psi, like  many of the older books state.  You also need a pump that will supply an adequate volume of fuel, not just pressure, as volume is what's needed  to keep the  float bowl full under periods of high demand. As such, we recommend  a high volume, low pressure  pump, that delivers 60-75 GPH at 4-5 psi.</span></strong><span class="style3B"> The  Carter 4070, which is a rotary pump, is an excellent choice. This pump does not need, and should not use, a fuel pressure regulator for any reason.</span> Weber/Redline also makes a good fuel pump. In any case, make sure you use a high quality pump, rather than a cheap one. <strong><br />
  <span class="style3Bl"><br />
  </span><span class="style3B">Fuel pressure regulators are OK with  stock fuel pumps  that put out too much pressure,  however a regulator is   simply a restricter which may  inhibit flow. This  can  result in a huge loss of volume, which may result in the float bowl going low or  even empty under hard acceleration. Regulators </span></strong><span class="style3B"> can also overload the fuel pump, causing a lot of noise  and premature failure. </span>Therefore, if you use a regulator with your stock pump, make sure it's a high quality regulator and that the fuel pump is supplying an adequate amount 
  (volume)
  of fuel, and that it is capable of keeping the fuel bowl full at all times. We sell both Holley and Weber fuel regulators. The Weber regulator is twice the price, but it is highly recommended over the Holley regulator, as it was designed to work with Weber carbs. What ever you do, DO NOT use a High Pressure  fuel pump, electric or mechanical. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Ignition System</strong><br />
            First, you need to be certain that you have adequate spark  to burn the extra fuel, other wise you may have problems tuning and jetting your  carb. This is especially true with old cars that have point style ignition  systems. A lack of spark, or weak spark, will make it impossible to tune the  carbs properly, especially if your trying  to achieve maximum performance. If you have a few extra bucks,  we highly recommend replacing the old points style distributor with a good  electronic ignition system, which includes a performance coil and plug wires.  I guarantee you won't regret it. </p>

                  <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Ford distributors built from 64-67, called<a href="Loadomatic.html"> Load-O-Matic Distributors</a>, didn't have   centrifugal weights. Instead they relied on venturi vacuum to sense changes in RPM,  which was supplied by a Spark Control Valve. The SCV  was incorporated in all early stock Autolite 1100-1V carbs (until '68), which means when you replace the stock Autolite carb, you eliminate the Spark Control Valve, hence the  Load-O-Matic distributor will no longer function properly. As such the distributor  must be replaced when your doing a carb swap. Any late model or aftermarket distributor, that uses centrifugal weights to sense changes in RPM,  will work fine. Click<a href="Loadomatic.html"> here</a> for more detailed information. </p>

            <br />
            <p align="justify" class="style3B">Generally speaking, you may need a little more spark advance  with a Weber carb. A good place to start for most cars, with Weber&rsquo;s on pump  gas, is 12-14 Degrees advance at 1000 RPM idle and 36 Degrees total advance by  3000 RPM...This is not cast in stone and you need to make sure your car does  not detonate (or ping) at these setting. If you experience detonation  under load, you'll  need to back off (retard) the timing until it stops. <br />
              <br />
            Always start with a fresh set of Spark Plugs. Do not clean  them... start fresh. This will allow you to get a better plug reading, thereby enabling you to make a better judgment call on what needs to be  done. If you have multiple carbs, you may want to do a compression test as  well. If the results are off by more than 10% per cylinder you could have problems  when you go to tune the carbs. <br />
            <br />
            <strong> Factory Calibrations and Set-Up  </strong><strong><br />
            </strong>Before you go tearing into your carb, the very first thing you need to do is  make a record of the factory  calibrations or set-up. In other words, what parts (sizes) were in the carb when you pulled it out of the box.  Make certain you designate the differences, if any, between the primary and secondary circuits. Never rely on a list you found somewhere on a website or in a book, that says what your carb  might or should have  came with. Instead, remove the top of the carb and actually remove the jets, emulsion tubes, air correctors,  check the sizes, then  WRITE THEM DOWN. Don't use  a small piece of scrap paper that could get tossed out in the trash, write them down inside the front cover of your Ford or Weber service manual, or any place where you'll have a permanent record that won't get lost.   This way you'll always have the original factory settings if you ever need to refer or go back to them.</p>

                <span class="style3B">While you have the carb top plate off, this  is a great time to check the float level. The float level is a critical part of carburetor   calibration. Changing the fuel level in the bowl will change the point that the   main circuit starts to feed. Float level also alters the characteristics of an emulsion tube, and   affects the driveability and fuel consumption.</span></p>
            <p align="justify" class="style3B"> Float level, in mm, typically   refers to the distance from the face of the carburetor top cover to the float.   Start with the top cover held vertically (float pivot at the top) and with the float tab    resting against, but not depressing the spring loaded ball in the needle   valve. Measure the distance between the face of the carburetor top cover, to the top (or bottom)   of the float. On carburetor models where it is required to remove the float to   replace the top cover gasket, the measurement should be made with the gasket in   place.<br />
                <br />
                <strong>Choke Settings <br />
              </strong><span class="style3B">All settings are done with the choke disengaged, or warmed  up so that the choke is fully opened and disengaged. This is done on automatic  choke carburetors by first opening the choke butterfly by hand and inserting a  wood block, or a wedge of some kind. Next hold the choke open  while the linkage is cycled  (operated) through its full movement, to clear the choke cam. You will  hear a metallic click when the cam is released. Visually  check the fast idle screw,  under the choke assembly, to confirm that it is not in contact with the chokes  fast idle cam. Next, set the idle speed screw by backing out the  screw until it is not in contact with the  throttle stop lever. Cycle the linkage once more to be sure that the linkage  closes without any assistance, while checking for linkage bind. &nbsp;Now bring  screw back into contact with the lever and continue to open,  screwing in 1  turn but no more than 1&frac12; turns.</span>              <br />

            Now that you have everything else  sorted out, you can actually start tuning the carb. The good news is that you  probably made the car run good enough by doing all these other things, that you may not need to do anything else. However, if your car is still not running right,  or you feel  you should have more power, then it is time to rejet and tune the  carb. </p>

Synchronous carbs <strong class="style3B">have individual  idle jets and mixture screws for each barrel. They also have an additional air  bleed screw and lock nut.

            <p align="justify" class="style3B">              First, you'll need to establish if you are running lean or rich? There is no  way around this. You can be running rich at idle and lean on the main circuit,  or vice versa. There are a few easy ways to establish this, and it is important  to know, otherwise you won&rsquo;t be able to cure the problem. The first option is to  install A/F Gauge. It's fast and accurate, and it will take a lot of the  guesswork out of the tuning process. The only drawback is that they are pretty  expensive, but once you buy one, you'll always have it.  Another option (the best one in our opinion) is to have your car tuned on a chassis dyno, by a professional tunner. This isn't cheap either, but the results will be well worth the cos, and it usually pays for itself over time, in fuel svaings.  The final choice, and the most common, is to read the  spark plugs. Ideally you want the ceramic part of the plug a nice Dark Tan to  medium Brown color with a slightly darker ring right at the base of the plug threads. Remember, a new set of plugs may take a few minutes to get some color on them, so you'll need to run the motor for two to three minutes before shutting it down. The most important thing to know is white plugs are lean, while black plugs are rich.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Idle Mixture  </strong><span class="style4B">Screw and Idle Circuit </span><br />
            The idle mixture screw  and idle circuit is CRITICAL to the overall driveability of the car. Not only  does it control the idle, it also controls the entire low speed running circuit, as well as part throttle  transition. The mixture screw is not just an air screw, as in other carbs, it actually opens a passage and lets in a pre-mixed volume of fuel and air. The more you open it, the more pre-mixed  fuel enters the engine. Clockwise is leaner and counter-clockwise is  richer. <br />
            <br />
            Assuming you have no vacuum  leaks this is a very simple process. However if you cannot get a good adjustment  and you have to open the idle speed screw more than 2<span class="style3B">&frac12;</span> turns to get the  engine to idle, then there&rsquo;s a good chance you have a vacuum leak and you'll need  to fix it before going on. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style3B">Set the   mixture screw by first screwing it in until the screw stops, or bottoms   out, then back out the screw 1&frac12; turns. DO NOT FORCE IT, AS THIS WILL   DAMAGE  THE SCREW AND THE SEAT, WHICH IS IN THE BODY OF CARBURETOR. Start the engine and let it warm up. Do not worry about the idle speed at this point, just as long as the engine keeps running, as it will be re-adjusted  later on.   Start by  turn the mixture screw(s) in, until the idle starts to stumble and get rough,  then slowly turn them back out (turning &frac14; to &frac12; turn at a time) until the best idle quality is achieved.   Use   your ear, not a scope or gauges, as you want to tune the   engine by sound.  The car should idle well and once your done, small adjustments  clockwise (leaner) should make the idle speed drop off. </span><span class="style3B">Adjust to the best, fastest, and smoothest running point.</span><br />
            <br />
            <strong>Low   Speed Calibration </strong><br />
              <span class="style3B">If the mixture screw is   more than 2 1/2&nbsp; turns out, then the idle jet is too lean (too small). When   the mixture screw is less than 1&nbsp;turn, then the idle jet is too rich (too large).   These assumptions are based on the fact that the speed screw setting is not   opened more than 2 turns. If the speed screw has to be opened 2 or more turns   then this is also an indication of a lean condition usually requiring greater   change. At times it may appear to be showing signs of richness or flooding, but it is   really a lean condition. Please understand the need to keep throttle   plate as near to closed as possible, so as not to prematurely expose the   transition holes. This is what causes a visible rich condition, and confirms   the need to increase the jet size.</span>            <br />
              <br />
              The  38/38 DGES carbs can be a little tricky because you are idling on both barrels  at the same time. You have 2 mixture screws, which WILL NOT be set the same on  most carbs. This is because the plenum type log manifold distributes fuel unevenly.  By having 2 mixture screws you are delivering fuel from 2 places in the intake  manifold. Do not stagger the idle jets (in  other words, do not use 2 different size idle jets) even if you need to  adjust the screws differently, as this can cause part throttle driveability  issues.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Idle Speed</strong><br />
              <span class="style3B">Now that   the mixture screw is at its best running location, you can adjust the idle speed   screw. The screw will be sensitive and should only take &frac14;&nbsp; to &frac12; turns to set the idle speed to your driving preference. Don&rsquo;t set it too high, as this causes excessive wear on the clutch and brakes. The idle speed should be around 700-900 RPM. Recheck the speed screw and note how many   total turns from initial contact. The final setting should be under 2&frac12; full turns. </span><br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B"><strong>The Main Circuit  </strong></span><span class="style3Bl"><strong><br />
              </strong></span>Okay... so now your car should idle correctly. This is a good time to recheck the timing and vacuum hook ups, making sure everything is right. If so,  it&rsquo;s time to get the main circuit  tuned properly. First, do a test drive. It should come off of idle good, and  transition to the main circuit smoothly. If it falls on its face and will not  take any throttle, or if it runs better if you back off the throttle, then you could have a few  different problems. Note: If you do not  have enough spark advance,  you could experience the same problems and it may  have nothing to do with carb tuning.<br />
              <br />
             If you have a flat spot or hesitation when you  first take off, then it is likely that the idle circuit is too lean. If you know  for sure that you have the idle circuit set properly, then the primary main jet is too small.     If the car transitions fine, but hesitates or  falls on it face when the secondary is opened, you'll need to work on the secondary  main jet. <br />
             <br />
             Drive the car above 2000-3000 RPM for a few  minutes then shut the engine off before letting it idle, and check the plugs.  Do not let it idle when you are checking spark plug color for the main jets.&nbsp;Keep checking the plugs, after driving it for a few minutes, and  change the jets accordingly.<br />
            <br />
            Note: The DGV, DFV, and DGS carbs, unlike the DCOE or IDA carbs, have fixed chokes (what we call venturi's) so choke size is not an issue. DCOE and IDA carbs have removable chokes (or venturi's) which can be changed out,  thereby altering the cfm rating of the carb. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style4B">Plug Readings</span><br />
            When you check the plugs, the tip should be a hazy brown. If they are white, you need to run a cooler plug and/or richen the mixture. If they are dark brown or black, you need to run a hotter plug and/or  lean the mixture. Dark black usually means the plug is too cold, while dark brown means the mixture is rich. Blackish brown means cold and rich.

              Tuning for <a href="WeberHighAlt.html">High Altitude</a> operation, above 4000 feet, requires slightly different  settings and a wider range of replacement jets, for both the idle and main circuits, as well as larger air correctors. </p>

              Ordering Jet Kits from Classic Inlines <br />
              </strong>Classic Inlines stocks the standard aftermarket jet kits which are sold by other suppliers. These  kits were designed for mild performance motors using Weber 32/36 or 38/38 carbs, and are  very reasonably priced. However with a total of 10 jets (4 main jets, 4 air corrector jets, and 2 idle jets),  the kits are very limited and  they may not include the jets you need for your application.  As such, you basically have two choices.... buy the standard jet kit and hope it has what you need,  or go online and buy a handful of individual jets, in which case your probably still guessing on the sizes you'll need.  Either way, you probably won't have precisely the right size and you'll end up using one  that's &quot;close enough&quot;. The only other option is to buy every jet size available, or at least a wide range of jets. The only problem here,  the jets cost  more when they're purchased  individually. For this reason Classic Inlines decided to put together two Custom Jet Kits, a small kit with 35 jets, and a large kit with 75 jets. If you were to buy  the jets individually, these kits would cost in excess of $200/$500, respectively. However, we do things a little different. Basically you put down a refundable deposit when you order the kit, then when  your done tuning your carb, you return the kit and you're only charged for the jets  you used. Yes the kits are expensive up front, but you'll have every jet size you would possibly need to tune your  carb &quot;properly&quot;, and your money is refunded when the kit is returned. NOTE: These kits are only available to  customers who purchased a  Weber carb from Classic Inlines. Please call, or click <span class="style4R"><a href="productse5c7.html?cat=44">here</a></span> for more details. </p>
            <p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style3B"><strong>Ordering Jet Kits from other suppliers <br />

              </strong>Additionally you'll need to know which style of idle  jets you have. DGV and DFV carbs came equipped with 2 different idle  jet  styles. In some carbs,  both the Primary and Secondary idle jets are the same size, while in other carbs the  Primary idle jet is larger (see photos below).  You'll need to know how your carb is  equipped when you  order  parts. </span></p>

                <br />
                <span class="style4R">VIP: Make a record of the factory  calibrations or set-up. In other words, what parts (sizes) were in the carb when you pulled it out of the box.  Make certain you designate the differences, if any, between the primary and secondary circuits.              WRITE THEM DOWN. Don't use  a small piece of scrap paper that could get tossed out in the trash, write them down inside the front cover of your Ford or Weber service manual, or any place where you'll have a permanent record that won't get lost.   This way you'll always have the original factory settings if you ever need to refer or go back to them.</span><br />

                <strong>While the instructions above should get your car running properly, we highly recommend taking your car to a qualified Weber Technician for final tuning, or preferably, having it tuned on a chassis dyno. Tuning the motor on a chassis dyno is worth every penny, and you can rest easy, knowing the carb and ignition system have been  tuned properly for maximum performance and mileage. </strong></p>
            <p align="justify" class="style3Bl">We had a customer in southern California install a Weber 32/36 on his newly built performance motor. The shop that built and installed the motor, also set the carb up. Now these were great guys with excellent mechanical skills, however they didn't have a lot of experience with Weber carbs (most mechanics don't). As a result, they messed with the carb for two weeks, trying to get it tuned properly. When the customer finally got his car back, it was running OK, but he wasn't happy with the overall performance. Especially when he took into consideration all the money he spent having the motor rebuilt, which was a considerable amount. He finally called and spoke with me about the disappointing results, so I told him to have the car tuned on a chassis dyno. Two weeks later he called back to say thanks. He told me that he finally decided to follow my suggestion and had the car tuned on a chassis dyno. When they did the baseline pull, he was only making 105 RWHP, which was better then a stock motor, but not what he was hoping for. When they finished tuning the carb and ignition system, and hour later, he was pulling 145 RWHP.  That's a 40HP gain, just from tuning the motor properly. Not bad for $150 bucks. Now the car runs great and he's very happy with the results. The car runs  better than he expected, and he's getting 22 mpg. Moral of the story..... do your self a huge favor and have it tuned on a chassis dyno. I guaranty you won't be sorry. </p>
