            <br />
              The  12-Volt battery supplies the primary voltage   to the coil and ignition unit (if electronic). When the coil is activated by the   trigging device (contact points, electronic module, crank trigger, magnetic   reluctor, or other type of trigger), the coil builds and releases a secondary voltage which is sent to the distributor via the coil wire. It does this at a very high rate of recovery   speed.
              The secondary voltage (or spark) travels  through the distributor  to the   appropriate spark plug by means the rotor and   a plug wire, where it jumps the spark plug gap and ignites the mixture.</span></p>

            <p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style3B">Ignition Timing is the relationship (or the position) of the   piston and when  ignition spark occurs. If the ignition spark occurs too soon, it can   actually push against a piston while it is compressing   the fuel/air mixture, resulting in detonation, power loss, higher combustion   temperatures, backfires, and early  engine    failure. If the spark occurs too late, the ignition occurs   when the piston is traveling back down the cylinder, resulting in  wasted energy,   unburned fuel, higher emissions, and  power loss. Therefore it is obvious that the ignition spark must occur at precisely the right moment to achieve maximum power and efficiency.<br />
            <br />
On older  engines like our inline sixes, and most race cars with aftermarket distributors, the   ignition system uses a simple mechanical advance (or a combination of mechanical   and vacuum advance)  built into the distributor. As RPM increases, the mechanical and/or vacuum advance (weights and springs) moves   due to the spinning inertia occurring within the distributor, thereby advancing the ignition timing   in   relation to piston location based on engine speed.  Both the initial and the advanced timing, or a combination of (total timing) can be adjusting for your engine's optimum performance, which is referred to as the  timing curve.  Initial (or  idle) timing is set with a timing light by looking at the balancer mark and timing tab   indicator, and rotating the distributor. Advanced timing is adjusted by changing the weights and/or springs inside the distributor.</span><br />
<br />
          <span class="style3B">If the initial timing is set at 12&deg;, the spark is reaching the spark plug when the piston is <br />
          12&deg;  before top dead center (BTDC) at engine idle. However as engine rpm increases the   internal engine parts are moving faster, therefore you must get the spark in the cylinder sooner in order to ignite and allow the fuel air mixture to burn completely for  optimum power and efficiency. But not too   soon so that it  causes detonation or pre-ignition. </span><br />
          <br />
          <span class="style3B">Say for example that you have that 12&deg;   initial timing and 24&deg; of advanced timing, you would have    a &quot;Total&quot; timing of 36&deg;. However the 24&deg; of advanced timing does not happen all at once, as it occurs gradually as engine rpm's increase. Remember, as engine rpm increases, so does the inertia against the distributor weights within the distributor. The   springs holding the weights, is the opposite resistance force that controls the   speed, or rate, that the weights move outward  which advances the timing.
            By changing the size of the weights, you change the amount of advance that is applied. 
            By changing the spring pressures, you change the rate at which the advance  is applied.  A lighter spring  will make the advance occur faster, while a heavier spring will slow the advance rate. </span></p>

              <br />
              Aftermarket vacuum-advance units typically employ an Allen screw inside to   control advance rate. Turn the screw clockwise to slow the advance rate; while turning it   counterclockwise quickens advance rate. Ford's original vacuum-advance units had  shims inside and a spring designed to   control the advance rate. Add shims to slow the advance rate, or use fewer shims to   quicken the advance rate.</span></p>

            <p align="justify" class="style3B">              Ignition timing needs to be checked and tuned at least two different ways.   First, static ignition timing should be checked with the vacuum-advance hose   disconnected. Follow factory specifications for initial timing.<br />
            <br />
              With the vacuum advance reconnected, check total timing, which can be done two   ways. Total timing is checked at 3,500 rpm with the vacuum advance connected.   Ideally, push for the maximum number of degrees before BTDC without detonation   (pinging or spark knock). In most circumstances, total advance should be 34-36   degrees BTDC.<br />
              <br />
              The rate of advance is checked by goosing the throttle to wide open and   watching the timing mark with a timing light. If spark advance comes on too   quickly, the engine will tend to break up (misfire) and ping (spark knock),   which means you need to slow the rate of advance. If the engine noses over and   doesn't rev quickly, speed up the rate of advance.<br />
              <br />
              When the vacuum advance is dialed in just right, the engine revs smoothly and   crisply. On the road, power comes on quickly without hesitation or spark knock.   At sustained highway speeds, the engine should maintain a smooth demeanor   without misfire. If you feel a slight misfire at cruising speeds or hear pinging   under hard acceleration, you have too much timing.<br />
              <br />
              Another area to check is manifold vacuum. Healthy manifold vacuum is normally   15-22 inches at idle. Checking manifold vacuum is just as important as checking   compression and cylinder leak-down. It determines an engine's state of health.   Note that manifold vacuum gets tricky when the engine is fitted with an   aggressive camshaft or too much carburetor.

Advance the timing   while watching the vacuum gauge, when you get to a point of the highest vacuum   reading, stop advancing the timing and start to retard the timing until you see   a reduction of 2 inches of vacuum, from the highest reading. Lock down the distributor   and hook up your timing light and see how close you are to your preferred   initial timing setting.

            <p align="justify" class="style3B">          Maybe you've just built up a brand new engine, or upgraded to new heads and a   cam, perhaps you're simply trying to dial-in an existing combination. In either   scenario, one area of tuning that is highly overlooked and greatly misunderstood   is timing. All too often we see people dropping in their distributor, making a   quick adjustment with their timing light, and setting off to make another pass.   <br />
          <br />
          Timing is everything, and without a proper timing curve, every thing   else goes out the window. Jetting changes, fuel pressure adjustments, are all   useless if first the timing is not set correctly.<br />
          <br />
          <br />
          So what is timing?   In a nutshell, timing or 'ignition timing' relates to when the sparkplug is   fired in relation to piston position. At idle, when engine speeds are the   lowest, the plug fires just before the piston reaches the top of its stroke. As   engine speeds increase, the time between piston strokes is less, and therefore   the plug must fire sooner. In all cases the plug is fired in advance of the   piston reaching top dead center. There is a small window of time in which the   combustion need to take place in order to produce peak power. Too late and power   is lost, too soon and detonation occurs, which can lead to melted   pistons.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Why an engine needs more advance as its speed increases.</strong> <br />
          When the compressed mixture inside a cylinder is ignited it takes time for   the flame front to reach the piston and for the expanding gases to start pushing   it down. The time that this takes changes according to a number of variables   such as mixture strength, how well the cylinder has filled (dependent on   volumetric efficiency and throttle opening), compression ratio and combustion   chamber shape. Given the same cir***stances of mixture strength, cylinder   filling and CR, the time taken for the mixture to fully ignite and burn is the   same regardless of engine speed. At increasingly higher RPM however, the time   available for this burn to take place is correspondingly less, so it follows   that you have to start burning the mixture earlier in order for it to push on   the piston at the right time. This is the basis for increasing ignition advance. <br />
          Too much of this and the burning mixture hits the piston as it rises   (pinking or pinging), too little and the flame front reaches the piston far too   late and does not do a good job of pushing the piston down and the engine   behaves like a herd of turtles. One of the reasons a diesel engine does not   perform at higher RPM is that it has compression only ignition, so there is no   way to increase the effective ignition advance. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>How this is achieved</strong>. <br />
          The distributor as fitted to conventional ignition systems does not just   distribute the spark amongst the cylinders and switch the coil; it also contains   a centrifugal mechanism that advances the ignition timing automatically as   engine RPM rises. Normally there are a pair of weights within the distributor   which under the affects of centrifugal force tend to be thrown outwards, this   tendency is greater as RPM increases. The weights are shackled by two small   springs that restrain them progressively. As the weights move outwards they   exert a turning force on the top of the distributor shaft relative to the driven   part of the shaft, this moves in the same direction as the distributors rotation   thereby causing the points/electronic trigger to actuate earlier and advancing   the ignition timing. As engine speed increases the weights overcome more of the   spring's tension and advance the timing still more. There is normally a stop of   some kind that limits the amount of advance that the distributor can supply.   This centrifugal mechanism is usually hidden away underneath the base plate of   the distributor. 
          <br />
          <br />
          In this article we're going to focus primarily on   carbureted, non-computer controlled, engines which have fully adjustable   distributors. The EEC-IV computer controlled Fords allow for setting initial   timing, but the rest is adjusted by the computer. The newer modular engine Fords   have distributor-less ignitions which offer no adjustability from the factory,   although companies like Steeda have recently developed timing adjusters for   these engines. Some Fords, particularly in the 70's and early 80's, had   distributors where timing was fixed due to emissions reasons. <br />
          <br />
          When it   comes to timing the most common myth is that adjusting the timing simply means   moving the distributor clockwise or counterclockwise. While this does affect the   timing, it is not the correct way to adjust the timing curve. To explain why, we   first we need to define some terms. <br />
          <br />
          Advancing and retarding timing   refers to increasing or decreasing the 'time' at which spark is delivered to the   cylinders. This 'time' is measured in crankshaft degrees, signified by marks on   the harmonic balancer, and a reference pointer on the block or timing chain   cover. When the piston is at Top Dead Center (TDC), this is synonymous with zero   degrees on the balancer. Ten degrees before that point would mean the piston is   ten degrees of rotation from being at TDC. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>So how does the crank   position relate to the distributor?</strong><br />
          The distributor shaft on Ford engines   is driven by the camshaft gear, which is turned at half-crank speed by the   timing chain connected to the crankshaft. Thus there is a direct correlation   between the position of the crank and the position of the distributor. Remember,   the distributor is a switch. Regardless of the type of distributor you have,   there is a fundamental design common to all of them; the shaft is in a fixed   position, spinning in direct relation to the crankshaft. On the shaft sits the   trigger which activates the switch. On electronic distributors the trigger may   be a magnetic sleeve with eight openings, or in the case of points, its simply   an arm that open and closes the points. The distributor housing does not spin   and it contains the actual switch, such as the Petronix box, which is mounted   on a breaker plate. By rotating the housing you in effect move the position of   the switch, changing when it triggers a spark. When you rotate the distributor   to &quot;adjust the timing&quot; you are moving the switch on the housing side in relation   to the trigger on the shaft.<br />
          <br />
          Rotating the distributor housing clockwise   on a Ford advances the timing (i.e. spark is being fired a greater number of   degrees before the piston reaches TDC), and counterclockwise decreases the   timing. <br />
          <br />
          When referring to timing, there are really four terms that must   be considered; initial timing, mechanical (or centrifugal) timing, total timing,   and vacuum advance. There is also cam timing which is more appropriately termed   valve timing, since it deals with when the valves open and close in relation to   crank position. We won't talk about this since it has no dynamic bearing on   ignition timing.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Initial<br />
          </strong> This is the most common adjustment that   people associate with timing. At idle, with the vacuum advance hose disconnected   and plugged, this is the timing that you would see if you flashed timing light   on the timing marks. On typical stock engines you'd see as low as 0 to as high   as 15 degrees. Most Ford shop manuals specify around 6-8 degrees initial timing   advance for the 289-351 motors.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Mechanical/Centrifugal<br />
          </strong> Most V8   distributors contain an internal advance mechanism consisting of two each of   weights, springs, and slotted 'reluctor' arms. There is also a stop tab for the   arms. On Fords this assembly can only be seen by removing the cap, rotor, and   breaker plate; we'll get to removal a bit later. As the distributor shaft spins   with increasing rpm's, the centrifugal force acts on the weights, which begin to   force outwards against the springs. This movement rotates the shaft and thus   advances the timing. The slotted arm controls how much the weights can move the   assembly, and the springs control how fast the assembly reaches that limit. The   reluctor arm on a Ford has two slotted sides, only one side contributes to the   timing, the arm can be flipped around if more advance is needed (see pictures.)   On Fords each side is stamped with a number, usually 10L and 13L; or some have   15L and 18L. These numbers refer to 1/2 of the total degrees of timing that will   be obtained when using that arm. So for example a 15L arm would contribute 15 x   2= 30 degrees of timing when full against the stop. <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Total   Advance<br />
          </strong>So far we have looked at initial advance and mechanical advance.   Both of these combined gives total advance. Say for example initial was found to   be 6 degrees, and we visually verified that the reluctor arm was on the 15L   side. Total timing, theoretically, is then the initial + mechanical. In this   case 6 + (15 x 2) = 36 degrees. If we shined a timing light on the marks (with   vacuum hose disconnected and plugged), at idle we'd see 6 degrees, then as we   increased the engine speed, we'd see more and more advance, until at some point   the total centrifugal advance would be reached, and we would see 36 degrees.   When exactly the total advance occurs is of great importance when it comes to   performance, and we discuss this in the section below on   &quot;curving.&quot;<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Vacuum Advance<br />
          </strong> Most Ford distributors include a vacuum   advance mechanism. This consists of a diaphragm vacuum canister, an arm from the   canister to the breaker plate, and a hose connected to an engine vacuum source.   The purpose of this mechanism is to provide spark advance when the engine is not   spinning fast enough to create the centrifugal advance talked about earlier. In   other words this is an engine-load dependent advance. This would be a typical   situation when climbing a steep hill, or driving at low rpm's, light throttle,   conditions. In these conditions there is high engine vacuum, so the vacuum   signal applied to the diaphragm in the canister, via the hose, will cause a   'pull' effect on the arm, which moves the breaker plate and results in a timing   advance. During full throttle conditions there is very little engine vacuum, and   thus the vacuum advance does not contribute to total advance.<br />
          <br />
          Vacuum   advance is tricky to tune because there is no direct measurement like total. In   fact, the reason you must measure initial and total timing with the vacuum hose   disconnected is because when the engine is in neutral there no load, thus the   vacuum is high, and if the hose were connected you'd see as high as 60 degrees   advance and think something is really wrong! The only way to tune vacuum advance   is on the road, by feel, and AFTER the initial and total are adjusted. <br />
          <br />
          In short, vacuum advance was developed to optimize fuel economy and   reduce emissions. It is not a bad thing to have on a car which sees a lot of   street driving, and in such conditions the engine will perform better with it   properly adjusted. However many factory and aftermarket performance distributors   do not even come with a vacuum advance. The reason is simply because race cars   do not spend much time at part throttle.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Curving for   Performance</strong><br />
          A timing curve is simply a plot of how much ignition advance   takes place over the rpm range. In other words, when the timing advances is just   as critical as how much it advances. <br />
          <br />
          When it comes to performance there   are many different engine combinations, buildups, components, and uses&hellip;.Each   requiring slightly different timing curves. On the other hand if you have a   stock motor, and do not care for every extra horsepower, you really do not need   to do more than follow the shop manual procedures. However even a stock or mild   daily driver motor can be made to accelerate faster with a five minute timing   curve adjustment. <br />
          <br />
          The rule of thumb is that the higher the compression   ratio, the less total timing it can handle before detonation, and also the   higher octane rating it needs to control detonation. Low octane fuels ignite   faster, thus require less timing advance. Conversely high octane fuel can handle   slightly more advance. Dyno testing has shown that most small block Fords with   9:1 to 9.5:1 compression make peak HP with 38-42 degrees total advance. Engines   with 9.5:1 - 10.5:1 run best with 35-38 degrees total, and above 11:1, should   not go higher than 35 deg. total. When using power adders such as nitrous, super   or turbo chargers, the timing should be advanced accordingly. 
          <br />
          <br />
          The   first step in curving a distributor is to set your initial and total advance. As   detailed above and in the picture captions, the total is determined by the   reluctor arm setting plus the initial advance. Ideally you should keep the   initial between 10 and 20 degrees, and the total in the ranges listed above for   your compression ratio. For example, if you are shooting for 40 degrees total,   and your reluctor arm is on the 15L slot, you would have 30 degrees mechanical   advance, requiring the initial to be set at 10 degrees. <br />
          <br />
          The second step   is to dial-in how fast the distributor achieves the total advance. This is   controlled by the springs which hold back the weights, under the breaker plate.   A stock distributor usually has one light and one heavy spring, and brings the   timing in really slow, such that the distributor may only reach the total timing   at very high engine speeds, 4500+ for example. For performance driving, the best   acceleration comes when total advance is achieved within the range of 2000rpm to   3000 rpm. To adjust this rate, you can replace the stock springs with lighter   tension springs. You can also bend the tabs on which the springs connect to   change their tension. 
          <br />
          <br />
          Once you've set the initial and mechanical   timing, and adjusted the curve, you should be very very close, if not right at,   the optimum timing curve for wide-open throttle performance. You should use   timing light at this point to confirm that the initial timing is where you set   it, and steady, and then check the timing from idle to 3500 in 500rpm   increments. The curve should increase a few degrees at every checkpoint until   2500-3000rpm, where it hits the maximum. After 3000 it should not go beyond the   total advance.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>So How The Hell Do I Know How Much Advance I   Need???</strong><br />
          Read On&hellip;.<br />
          <br />
          <strong>Establishing Maximum Advance   Requirement</strong> <br />
          Notwithstanding the compression ratio and other factors, the   characteristic that determines the maximum advance setting is the shape of the   combustion chamber and the position of the spark plug. <br />
          <br />
          Combustion   Chamber Shape and Spark Plug Location<br />
          <br />
          Combustion chambers and spark plug   location and the number of plugs will have a marked effect on the time required   to complete the combustion process. A large open chamber like a hemi which has a   high surface to volume ratio, will combust more slowly than a wedge or modern   pentroof chamber simply because it has more cold, metal molecules in contact   with the combustion gasses which tends to slow reaction rates. For this reason,   these chambers will require that the spark be initiated sooner to achieve PCP at   the correct time.<br />
          <br />
          The slowest combusting chamber would be an open chamber   with a large bore size and the spark plug at one edge of the chamber. The flame   front has a long distance to cover to complete combustion. By placing the plug   in the center of the chamber, you halve the distance that the front needs to   travel and will be able to reduce the spark advance needed to achieve maximum   power. Another solution would be to add another spark plug to create two flame   fronts which would also require much less time to combust. This is the solution   in most aircraft engines where big bores and poor fuel distribution and homogeny   require solutions to increase ignition probability.<br />
          <br />
          Modern 4 valve   engines with shallow pentroof chambers and a central plug location are fast,   efficient combustors, requiring minimal advance for maximum   power.
          <br />
          <br />
          Most small block fords use a heart shaped combustion chamber.   These require 36-38 degrees. Factor in your compression ration from above and   come up with a number in the middle. These few degrees difference can be made up   for with a small adjustment to the initial timing to save from modifying the   reluctor arms again.
          <br />
          <br />
          <strong>Establishing static advance requirement</strong> <br />
          The static advance requirement for a modified engine is very much dependent   on the duration of the cam fitted. Below is a table of advance requirements and   expected idle speeds for a range of cam specifications. ON NO ACCOUNT use these   settings before the maximum advance on the distributor has been correctly   limited.            </p>

            <p align="justify" class="style3B">              When   establishing static advance the golden rule is never use less than 10; never use   more than 20 degrees. The engine may well tolerate more than 20 degrees at idle,   but the moment the throttle is opened and cylinder filling is improved it will   ping heavily. One problem often encountered when using more static advance than   standard is that the engine may 'kick-back' when starting causing the starter to   slow dramatically, this can be confused with a flattened battery or worn starter   motor. You may need to compromise by the odd degree or two if your engine will   not tolerate the required degrees of advance at start-up. <br />
              <br />
              Static advance   implies a measurement taken when the engine is stationery, however it is usually   set at idle in order that any latency in the distributor drive gear is taken up.   A rough setting can be made when the engine is still, but it MUST be set at   1300RPM or lower with the vacuum advance disconnected so that any latency is   taken up and the centrifugal advance has not yet started its operation. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Establishing mechanical advance requirement </strong><br />
              We have our   desired static and maximum advance figures already calculated, so now we can use   the same simple formula to establish how much centrifugal advance we need from   the distributor. 
              Example: Maximum advance 38 degrees, required static   advance 18 degrees (38-18) = 20 degrees required. 
              In our example the   standard distributor is designed to give maximum advance from a starting point   of say 10 degrees of static advance, if the maximum advance required is 38   degrees, then it's range is 28 degrees (38-10), this means that if the static   setting is increased to 18 degrees, then the total advance will be 46 degrees   (18+28), way too much. It is unlikely that the standard distributor will give   the correct amount of advance, it will usually give too much. This is why we   must restrict the total centrifugal advance that the distributor is capable of   supplying to our new figure, in this case 20 degrees, then with the static   setting of 18 degrees, the maximum advance will be 38 degrees (18+20), the   correct figure. <br />
              <br />
              If the advance supplied is MORE than required, and this is   highly likely, it means as expected that the distributor is supplying too much   mechanical advance, and that the stops in the distributor must be bent to   restrict the travel of the mechanism. If the advance supplied is LESS than   required which is unusual, then the distributor is supplying too little   mechanical advance and the stops must be filed to allow more travel of the   advance mechanism.
              <br />
              <br />
              <strong>So what about Vacuum   Advance?</strong><br />
              Under conditions of light or   closed throttle, the volumetric efficiency of an engine is quite poor, and   cylinder filling is affected to the extent that the effective compression ratio   is much lower than the static or calculated compression ratio. In these   cir***stances the mixture will burn much more slowly than with a fully filled   cylinder and the flame front will reach the piston quite late. This can   dramatically cut the overall efficiency of the engine and its economy. Under   these conditions the engine will tolerate and indeed benefit from advancing the   timing by up to 15 degrees over its normal setting. <br />
              <br />
              The device that usually   performs this trick is called the vacuum advance device. The way this works is   to exploit the partial vacuum that is present in the inlet manifold when the   throttle is closed or partly closed. A tube is connected from the manifold to a   sealed diaphragm in the distributor, which in turn is connected to the   distributors base plate. The suction deflects the diaphragm which turns the base   plate against the direction of rotation of the distributor thereby advancing the   timing, this gives much better throttle response on part throttle, and far   better economy. <br />
              <br />
              Many people who tune engines disconnect the vacuum advance   mechanism, and indeed on some distributors it is very hit and miss in operation   and can cause anomalies in the timing. All in all however for a road engine, the   vacuum advance retard should be retained if it is possible to do so (not always   easy with side draught carbs). This will have a dramatic affect on economy and   driveability especially on small throttle openings and when   'off-cam'.<br />
              <br />
              Most Ford distributors include a vacuum advance mechanism.   This consists of a diaphragm vacuum canister, an arm from the canister to the   breaker plate, and a hose connected to an engine vacuum source. The purpose of   this mechanism is to provide spark advance when the engine is not spinning fast   enough to create the centrifugal advance talked about earlier. In other words   this is an engine-load dependent advance. This would be a typical situation when   climbing a steep hill, or driving at low rpm's, light throttle, conditions. In   these conditions there is high engine vacuum, so the vacuum signal applied to   the diaphragm in the canister, via the hose, will cause a 'pull' effect on the   arm, which moves the breaker plate and results in a timing advance. During full   throttle conditions there is very little engine vacuum, and thus the vacuum   advance does not contribute to total advance.<br />
              <br />
              Vacuum advance is tricky to   tune because there is no direct measurement like total. In fact, the reason you   must measure initial and total timing with the vacuum hose disconnected is   because when the engine is in neutral there no load, thus the vacuum is high,   and if the hose were connected you'd see as high as 60 degrees advance and think   something is really wrong! The only way to tune vacuum advance is on the road,   by feel, and AFTER the initial and total are adjusted. <br />
              <br />
              In short, vacuum   advance was developed to optimize fuel economy and reduce emissions. It is not a   bad thing to have on a car which sees a lot of street driving, and in such   conditions the engine will perform better with it properly adjusted. However   many factory and aftermarket performance distributors do not even come with a   vacuum advance. The reason is simply because race cars do not spend much time at   part throttle.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Setting Vacuum Advance.</strong><br />
              Vacuum advance canisters are usually adjustable with a 3/32-in.   allen wrench, as shown here. The small screw inside the housing adjusts the   tension on the diaphragm spring. If you detect knocking and loss of power, back   the screw out (counterclockwise) to decrease advance. If the engine pops and   surges, tighten up the screw to increase advance. <br />
              <br />
              Note:When checking   initial and total advance, always disconnect the vacuum advance hose. Otherwise   you will get very high timing readings.<br />
              <br />
              <strong>Tuning Vacuum Advance</strong>. <br />
              The   last step, after the total advance curve is set, is to dial in the vacuum   advance if you have one. There should be a vacuum line connected from the carb,   or the manifold, to the vacuum canister. There are two types of vacuum sources   that you should be aware of. One type is known as &quot;full&quot; vacuum or &quot;manifold&quot;   vacuum. This is a direct connection to the manifold, and if the hose is   connected to this port you will get vacuum in the line at idle. The other port   is a &quot;timed&quot; port, which only yields a vacuum above a certain rpm. At idle the   line will have no vacuum. Most carburetors have both ports. On Holley's the   timed is above the throttle blades, and the &quot;full&quot; is below, near the base. On   Carter/Edelbrock carbs, the timed port is on the passenger side and the full is   on the driver's side. The easiest way to confirm what port you have is to hook   up a vacuum a gauge and check for vacuum at idle. The preferred vacuum source is   the timed source. This way there is no effect on the initial timing   setting. <br />
              <br />
              Remember vacuum advance is load dependent, so you cannot   check it with a timing light with the car in neutral. The best way to set vacuum   advance is by feel, under real driving conditions. Connect the vacuum line and   drive the car up a steep, long grade, with the car in high gear and at a low   speed, 30-40mph. Occasionally push the accelerator to the floor, and listen and   feel for knocking and/or loss of power. If you detect this, immediately back of.   This means the canister is advancing too much and you should adjust the canister   so the diaphragm is 'tighter', by turning the screw counterclockwise.<br />
              <br />
              You   can also adjust the vacuum canister clockwise until it does start to ping and   then back it off 2 turns. This should set your Vacuum Advance   perfectly.</p>
