            <p align="justify" class="style17"><span class="style3B">              Every engine requires a certain amount of oil   flow to keep the bearings, camshaft, valvetrain and other moving parts   lubricated. Oil forms a barrier that prevents metal-to-metal contact and reduces   friction and wear. In the bearings, it forms a wedge that actually lifts and   supports the crankshaft and camshaft as they rotate.</span></p>
            <p align="justify">Oil also serves as the primary means   of cooling the bearings as well as the pistons. What's   more, oil also serves as a hydraulic fluid inside hydraulic lifters.</p>
            <p align="justify">With so many important jobs to do,   it's obvious that the engine needs a good oil pump to   deliver a steady supply of oil. But how do we know if the bearings and other   moving parts are getting enough oil? Since there's no   simple way of measuring oil flow inside an engine, we look at oil pressure as a   means of gauging oil flow and lubrication.</p>
            <p align="justify">Oddly enough, an oil pump   doesn't create oil pressure. All the pump does is   displace oil and push it into the oil galleys so it can flow to the bearings and   upper valvetrain. What actually creates the oil pressure is the resistance the   oil encounters as it circulates through the engine.</p>

            </table>
            <p align="left" class="style17"><span class="style3B">There are three basic types of oil   pumps:</span></p>
            <ul type="disk">
              <li>
                <p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Twin gear pumps</span>: also called   &quot;external&quot; pumps, use a pair of intermeshing gears to pump oil. One gear is   driven by a shaft, and the second gear is driven by the first gear. The pump is   usually driven by a shaft that connects to the crankshaft, camshaft or   distributor shaft. Thus, the pump operates at half engine rpm. The pump gears   turn in opposite directions. This traps oil between the gear teeth and carries   it around the outside of each gear from the pickup tube inlet to the pump   outlet. The tight clearances between the gears prevents the oil from flowing   backwards to the inlet.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Rotor pumps:</span> also called &quot;gerotor&quot;   pumps, have an inner gear that turns inside an outer rotor. The inner gear has   one less lobe than the outer rotor. The inner gear is   also mounted slightly off-center to the outer rotor which forces the outer rotor   to spin at about 80 percent of the speed of the inner gear. This creates a bellows-like pumping action that pulls oil from the   inlet port and pushes it toward the outlet port. Close tolerances are required   for good pumping efficiency. This type of pump may also be located in the   crankcase.</p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p align="justify"><span class="style4B">Front cover pumps:</span> also called   &quot;internal/external pumps&quot; are usually located in the front engine cover. This is   also a rotor style pump with an inner drive gear and outer rotor, but the inner   gear is mounted directly on the crankshaft. The direct drive approach eliminates   the need for a separate pump drive shaft. This type of   pump turns at the same rpm as the engine, so it generates more pressure at idle   and does a better job of sucking oil from the crankcase and getting it to the   upper valvetrain in a hurry. That's why front cover pumps are used on many overhead cam engines. When   this type of pump becomes worn, it isn't always   necessary to replace the entire cover assembly -   provided the pump housing inside the cover   isn't worn or damaged. <strong>&nbsp;</strong>A new drive gear can be   mounted on the crankshaft and a new rotor installed in the cover to rejuvenate   the pump.</p>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p align="justify">With all three   types of pumps, wear and damage are major concerns. Wear that increases internal   clearances between the gears, rotor and housing will reduce the amount of oil   the pump displaces and cause a drop in oil pressure and delivery volume. That's   why high mileage oil pumps often have to be replaced.   The oil pump is the only internal engine component that runs on unfiltered oil.   The screen in the crankcase pickup tube will only keep out the big pieces of   debris, not the micron sized particles that can scour away metal over a long   period of time. Consequently, the oil pump can be easily damaged by debris that   ends up in the crankcase. Pump seizure caused by debris as small as .010? can   cause a complete engine failure by starving the engine for oil. &quot;High volume&quot; oil pumps are another variety common in the   aftermarket. </p>
            <p align="justify">High volume pumps typically have   longer gear sets to displace more oil. A high volume oil pump may flow 20 to 25   percent more oil than a stock pump to increase oil pressure at idle and to   compensate for increased bearing clearances and wear in a high mileage engine.   But a high volume oil pump is no cure-all for worn bearings or sloppy bearing   clearances. What about &quot;high pressure&quot; oil pumps. These   have a stiffer relief valve that doesn't open until a higher pressure is reached   (75 psi or higher). This type of pump can provide additional oil pressure at   high rpm when the pump is working hard, but it won't have any effect on idle   pressure when the pump is turning slowly. Most engine   rebuilder's replace the oil pump because they don't want to jeopardize engine   reliability by reusing an old pump. Another item that should always be replaced   (but sometimes isn't) is the pickup tube and screen. Swishing an old pickup in   some solvent may only loosen the crud inside that's accumulated over the years,   allowing it to be sucked into the new pump as soon as the engine is started.   Since there's no way to see inside some pickup tubes, the safest bet is to   install a new one.</p>

            </table>
            <p align="justify">            Oil pressure   is created when the positive displacement oil pump sucks up oil from the pan and   pushes it through the filter into the engine's main oil gallery. The oil is then   routed to where it is needed: the main bearings, rod bearings, cam bearings,   upper valvetrain and timing chain or tensioner. The   oil's viscosity makes it thick and slows the flow as it passes through the   passages and bearings. The amount of pressure created thus depends on the   bearing clearances as well as the oil's viscosity. Tighter clearances and/or   heavier viscosity equal more pressure. As the pressure   builds up in the oil system, it has to go somewhere. A spring-loaded &quot;pressure   relief valve&quot; built in the oil pump (or next to the pump) opens when pressure   exceeds a certain limit and either reroutes oil back into the pump's inlet or   the oil pan. This prevents a dangerous build-up of pressure that could rupture   the oil filter or blow out pressed-in oil gallery plugs. Most relief valves are   set to open when oil pressure exceeds about 50 psi.</p>
            <p align="justify">At idle, most oil pumps do not produce   enough flow to force open the relief valve. Oil pumps that are camshaft-driven   only turn at half engine speed so output isn't great at idle and low rpm. Even   pumps that are crankshaft-driven and turn at engine speed (or double engine   speed in a few instances) don't pump enough oil to overcome the relief valve   spring. The relief valve generally only comes into play   at higher rpm's when the pump's output pushes more oil into the system than it   can handle. Then the relief valve opens to vent oil and limit maximum oil   pressure until the engine returns to idle or a lower rpm. Most manufacturers recommend a minimum of 10 psi of oil pressure   for every 1,000 rpm of engine speed. Using these numbers, most stock engines can   get by with 50 to 60 psi of oil pressure. But some engines have different   requirements, so always follow the manufacturer's recommendations.</p>

            <p align="justify">            The first   indication of low oil pressure is usually a flickering oil warning lamp at idle,   or a lower than normal gauge reading. Unfortunately, most warning lamps won't   come on until the oil pressure is really low, like 4 to 5 psi. If the warning   isn't noticed or heeded, the next indication may be valve clatter as the   hydraulic lifters or lash adjusters run out of oil. If the loss of oil pressure   continues much longer, the next sound will be the rods knocking followed by a   long silence after the bearings seize. Low oil pressure   is bad news because it usually means the engine isn't getting enough oil, and   that can lead to serious trouble very quickly for the rod and main bearings, and   upper valvetrain components (especially overhead camshafts). For this reason,   any indication of low oil pressure should not be ignored and should be diagnosed   immediately. Low oil pressure can be caused by a   variety of things:</p>

            </ul>
            <p align="justify">If a freshly   built engine has unusually low oil pressure, it probably means there's too much   clearance in the bearings. Only about .001&nbsp;of extra clearance in the main   bearings can reduce oil pressure up to 20 percent! Sloppy bearing clearances   also create more oil splash inside the crankcase, which can overwhelm the rings   and cause the engine to use oil. Too much bearing clearance will also increase   engine noise and pounding, which will eventually lead to bearing fatigue and   failure.</p>
            <table width="578" border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" bgcolor="#000000">

            </table>
            <p align="justify">            To catch oil   pressure problems before the engine goes out the door, many engine builders will   spin the engine to make sure it is developing oil pressure, compression and   vacuum. It's also a good way to make sure the oil system is fully primed before   the engine is started. Start by checking the oil level   on the dipstick. If the oil level is low, the engine may be leaking and/or   burning oil. Adding oil may temporarily restore normal oil pressure - but unless   the oil level is maintained the problem will return.</p>
            <p align="justify">If the engine is leaking oil, the   faulty gaskets or seals will have to be replaced. Common installation mistakes   that can cause gaskets to leak or fail prematurely include over tightening the   fasteners and crushing the gaskets, using sealers or RTV on molded rubber   gaskets (makes them slip out of place), reusing valve covers and oil pans with   damaged or warped sealing lips and using cheap, ill-fitting gaskets or ones that   can't hold up. Also note the condition of the oil and   make sure it is the correct viscosity for the vehicle and prevailing weather   conditions. For most late model vehicles, the crankcase should contain 5W-30 or   10W-30. For older high mileage engines, 10W-40, 20W-50 or even straight 30W or   40W oil can help maintain good oil pressure in hot weather. But 20W-50 and   straight 30 and 40 are too thick for cold weather driving and may cause start-up   lubrication problems especially in overhead cam engines. Light viscosity oils   such as 5W-20 and straight 10W can provide good lubrication in cold weather but   may be too thin for warm weather or high mileage engines.</p>
            <p align="justify">If the oil level is okay, the next   thing to check would probably be the oil pressure sending unit. Disconnect the   unit and check the warning lamp or gauge reading. If the warning light remains   on with the sending unit disconnected, there's probably a short to ground in the   warning lamp circuit. Likewise, if there's no change in   a gauge reading the problem is in the instrumentation not the   engine. Bad oil pressure sending units are fairly   common. But if the warning lamp is still on after replacing the unit, guess   what? You just replaced a sending unit unnecessarily. A better approach is to   unscrew the sending unit, hook up a pressure gauge to the fitting on the block   and take an actual pressure reading with the engine running.</p>
            <p align="justify">If oil pressure reads low at idle,   check for a plugged oil filter. Is the filter OK? Then you'll probably have to   drop the oil pan to inspect the oil pump, pickup screen and   bearings. With a crankcase-mounted pump, you can remove   the pump cover and check the pump's internal clearances for wear or damage. If   the pump appears to be in good condition, that leaves the bearings. Check the clearances on the main bearing closest to the pump (since   this has the greatest effect on pressure), and clearances on the furthest rod   bearing (since this will show the greatest wear). If the bearings in a newly   built engine appear to be worn or damaged, you may be dealing with an oil   contamination problem (leftover machining residue inside the block or oil   pan). Don't install any new bearings until you've   carefully inspected the oil filter and inside of the oil pan for contaminants.   Also, you should re-measure the crankshaft journals with a micrometer to check   for dimensional accuracy and damage. Other checks might   include camshaft end play, and/or pulling a valve cover or the intake manifold   to check the cam bearings and lifters. Remember, excessive clearances or leaks   anywhere in the engine's oil supply system can contribute to low oil   pressure.</p>

            <p align="justify">            If the oil   pressure seems fine one minute, then suddenly drops, it usually means air is   being sucked into the oil pump. This can be caused by low oil level, an   improperly mounted oil pickup (too high in the oil pan), leaks between the   pickup and pump, or too much oil in the crankcase. In the case of too much oil   in the crankcase, windage from the spinning crankshaft whips the oil into foam.   A missing or loose windage tray inside the oil pan may be a contributing   factor. If the oil pressure surges at higher rpm's, it   may be the result of air being drawn into the pump for any of the just mentioned   reasons, or a sticking pressure relief valve. Sometimes an engine can run out of   oil at higher rpm if the return passages in the head and block are restricted   and don't allow the oil to drain back into the pan quickly enough. </p>

            <p align="justify">            Though less   common, too much oil pressure can also create problems. The most likely cause   here is a stuck relief valve in the oil pump. If the pressure valve fails to   open, pressure can reach dangerously high levels and may rupture the oil filter   or force out oil gallery plugs. Replace the pump or valve (if separate) to cure   this condition. Other causes of excessive oil pressure   can include a restriction or blockage in the main oil gallery, or a combination   of tight bearing clearances, high rpm operation and using an oil viscosity   that's too thick.</p>
