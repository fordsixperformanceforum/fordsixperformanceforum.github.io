          <td width="100%" height="489" colspan="2"><p align="justify">            We get numerous e-mails each week, asking how to build up an inline six, so we decided to do a tech article with our recommendations. 
            This information is only intended as a basic guideline, for building a daily driver, a weekend cruiser, or all out race engine. However there are certainly alternative methods and/or opinions for accomplishing such a task, therefore we recommend  you do as much research as possible, before you start buying parts or tearing into your motor. While we have provided a wealth of information  in our <a href="Tech.html">Tech Section</a> and through the various <a href="Magazines.html">Magazine Articles</a>,  we    recommend purchasing a <a href="http://www.fordmanuals.com/estore/scripts/default.asp">Ford Repair Manual</a>,  as well as   the <a href="proddetail733c.html?prod=FSP%2D200%2DFSH">Ford Falcon Six-Cylinder Performance Handbook</a>. <br />
              <br />
              To increase power you need to address the induction and exhaust systems,   combustion ratio and cam profile, and the ignition system.  Unlike many small   4-cylinder engines, you don't need to buzz a small six to 7500 rpm to make   power. In fact you can build substantial levels of power and torque, at very useable   levels of rpm (2500-5000), for a daily driver or weekend cruiser. Installing   headers and bolting on more carburetion to an otherwise stock engine, is a good   place to start and will certainly help the performance. However the total gains   may be disappointing and only make the shortcomings of the cylinder head, with   its integral log intake manifold, and  the stock cam more evident. Basically an   engine is a big air pump, and as such, the modifications must be performed   systematically in order for them to work together to produce the level of performance you desire. <br />
              <br />
              While we have included guidelines for  rebuilding the short block, you can skip over this step if it isn't required, or if it doesn't fit within your budget.   The remaining steps (2-6) can be done all at once, or one at a time, and in any order. However  we normally recommend up-grading the ignition and exhaust systems first. When up-grading the cylinder head, it may be beneficial to purchase a second head, thus reducing the downtime. This is also a good time to do the cam swap, as the cylinder head must be removed to swap the cam &amp; lifters. <br />
              <br />
              After  the following modifications have been accomplished, the rear wheel horse power should be around 175HP (double that of a stock six), with gas mileage falling in the 20-26 mpg range. If the motor is properly tuned,  it will have a smooth idle, excellent acceleration and throttle response, and plenty of power for   climbing  long hills or cruising down the freeway. <br />
              <br />
              Below is a brief outline of the steps required to build a budget motor, as well as several options for increased performance and/or service life. If you wish to  review each step in  detail,  click on the appropriate heading, or  simply page down. Our intentions were to give you as much information as possible, thus demonstrating  the   various possibilities for building a mild performance motor. We've included several  tech articles to  help guide you along, or to explain  a specific topic in greater detail, so be prepared to spend  an hour or more to go through all of the information provided.    If you're doing the work yourself,  you might want to read  the  article on <a href="Tips.html"> Engine Rebuilding &amp; Safety Tips</a>. <br />

            <p align="justify"><span class="style3B">For the most part</span> <span class="style3B">the same guidelines apply to both the 200ci and 250ci when rebuilding a short block, with the exception of piston selection, deck height, and   the  compression ratio, which we will detail later in this article.  Remember to inspect your motor mounts,  and replace them if necessary. <br />
              </span>  <span class="style4B"><br />
            Crankshaft:</span> While a four main short block is adequate for most  street motors, we always recommend starting with a seven main block,  in case you decided to hop up the motor or add a turbocharger at a later date. Not only is the seven main block virtually indestructible, the additional main caps help to minimize the harmonics of  the  long crankshaft, thus increasing the durability and service life of the motor. To further reduce  harmonic vibrations, we highly recommend balancing the rotating assembly, including the crank, con-rods, pistons, flywheel, and clutch assembly (if applicable). If you have an automatic, you also need to inspect the flex plate. As a general rule, it's a good idea to replace it even if you don't see any physical evidence of wear and tear, as they are prone to cracking. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style3B">Note: </span><span class="style3B">200ci engines produced mid '64 or later, as well as all 250ci engines, have 7 mains.</span> <br />
            <br /> 
            <span class="style4B">Damper:</span> This is also a good time to   replace the <a href="Balancer.html">harmonic damper</a> (also called  a balancer). Using an old worn out damper, or an inadequate   damper for the application,  usually results in  inertia   ring slippage (spinning), which in turn results in the loss of timing accuracy and eventual  component separation. A  good quality rebuilt or new replacement balancer, or high performance balancer should be used if you plan to operate your motor   frequently in the upper rpm ranges, as in  a street/strip application. <br />
            <br />
            <span class="style4B">Bore Size:</span> When machining the block, never bore the cylinders more than is absolutely necessary. While .060 is the maximum you can safely over bore a small six, we recommend keeping it at .040 or less, as over boring   adds very little power.  On the other hand, it  increases the likely-hood  of over-heating, especially in warmer climates, and  it weakens the cylinder walls. If you plan to add a turbo at a later date, we recommend a maximum bore of .020 over to maintain block integrity and reduce the likely-hood of  cylinder wall failure. If you plan to add more than 12 lbs of boost, a virgin block (0.00 over) is preferable. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B"> Pistons &amp; C/R (200ci):</span> While a stock 200ci  has a compression ratio of 8.7-9.2, depending on the production year, we recommend increasing the C/R   to 9.3-9.5 to enhance  the throttle response and over-all performance. Increasing the C/R to anything above 9.5 requires premium pump gas at a minimum, and it may require water injection to prevent detonation when using a cast iron head, therefore it is considered undesirable. A common practice to increase the C/R is to use flat top pistons (see note below), however for a 200ci we prefer to use the stock dished (7cc) pistons, along with  a zero decked block. Not only does this method improve the  quench characteristics, it decreases the likely-hood of detonation and pre-ignition.
              &quot;Zero Decking&quot; is accomplished  by machining  the deck (the block surface where the cylinder head attaches)  so that the top of the piston  is flush with  the top  of the block, when the piston is at top dead center.  <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Note:</strong>              If you  wish to use flat tops pistons, you can use pistons from a <span class="style3B">141ci four-cylinder Tempo  HSC, as they have the same bore size  and compression height  as a stock </span>  200/250ci piston. They will not work in a 144/170, as they have a small piston diameter. </p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="style4B"><a name="SB250ci" id="SB250ci"></a>Optional Pistons (250ci only):</span><span class="style3B"> If your rebuilding  a 250ci, you can use use pistons from a 255ci-V8 (80-81 Granada) to increase the C/R. These pistons  have a  compression height of 1.585&rdquo; verses 1.500&rdquo;. Using these pistons  is basically  the same as decking the  block 0.85&quot;, as it raises  the piston .085&quot; higher in the cylinder. Make sure you d</span>e<span class="style3B">ck the block   accordingly (do not Zero Deck), and adjust the combustion chamber size, to achieve a 9.0-9.5 C/R. We highly recommend using  an online  C/R Calculator, or a Cam Utility Program, to assist you in determining the proper deck height and chamber size, for the desired C/R.            </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="style3B"><strong>Compression Ratio</strong></span><span class="style4B"><strong>:</strong></span> Here's a few tips to  increase the Static Compression Ratio. However,  these are  &quot;Rule of Thumb&quot; guidelines, and as such, they should not be used to determine the actual Static C/R, or the Dynamic C/R. To determine the actual ratios we suggest using an online  calculator to determine the Static C/R, and/or a Cam Utility Program to determine  the Dynamic C/R, which will also assist you in selecting the proper cam profile by denoting the best time for the intake valve to close. For more information on Static and Dynamic Compression Ratios, and their differences, we <span class="style4B">highly recommend</span> reading our <a href="CompressionR.html">tech article</a>. </p>

            <p align="justify"><span class="style4B"><a name="SBoptions" id="SBoptions"></a>Forged Pistons &amp; Coatings:</span> Forged pistons are not  needed for the average street or high performance motor. They are only required  when power adders are introduced, such as a turbocharger, supercharger, or nitrous.   <br />
              <br />
              High Performance Coatings (HPC) offers two specialized coatings for upgrading stock or forged pistons.  Thermal barrier coatings  can be applied to the top of the piston, and/or the cylinder walls, to maintain combustion temperatures and reduce   heat soak.  Thus promoting a more efficient burn of the air/fuel mixture, which in turn increases the horsepower output. The S-Series solid dry film lubricant, when applied to the  piston skirt, reduces   friction and  prevents scuffing and galling of the cylinder walls.  By reducing friction  and  parasitic losses,  the  power output is enhanced, and   the service life of the motor is  greatly increased.<br />
              <br />            
              <span class="style4B">Piston Rings:</span> When selecting piston  rings, we recommend moly rings over cast iron. Cast iron rings are  fine for typical light duty service where the vehicle is not subjected to long  periods of high speed and is run primarily on paved streets, or when the motor  is not subjected to unusual dirt or heat conditions. However moly (molybdenum) rings are preferred for occasional  or continuous high speed and/or load conditions, where the engine is subject to  periods of high temperature ranges. Moly rings have a high scuff  resistance, superior strength, and improved oil control and retention, which makes them better suited to performance engines where they are expected to serve  adequately, through-out the entire life of the engine.<br />
              <span class="style4B"><br />
              Connecting Rods:</span> The next item to cover in the short block, is the connecting rods. Most sixes came with forged steel connecting rods, with the <span class="style3B">exception of those produce from 1973 thru 1981.</span> During those years Ford used a variety of materials, from cast steel, to cast iron, to nodular iron. In 1982, they switched back to forged steel rods once again. As such,  the rod bolts are the weakest point in the bottom end, and they should always be replaced when rebuilding a motor. We recommend using ARP small block Ford (V8) rod bolts, for increased safety and strength, however they  need to be installed by your machine shop as a small modification is required for fitment.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B">Shot Peening:</span> While not required for the average  street motor,  shot peening  is an option used to increase the  fatigue life of a stock connecting rod. By compressing the surface layer of the connecting rod, the likely-hood of failure from fatigue, stress cracks, and/or  corrosion is greatly   reduced.  Another common practice is to eliminate stress risers by de-burring the rods and grinding  all edges to a smooth radius prior to shot peening. <br />
              <br />
            <span class="style4B">Motor Mounts:</span> This is a great time to inspect  the motor and transmission mounts, which are commonly metal parts bonded together using a rubber compound. Over the years the rubber compounds dries out and becomes   brittle, eventually resulting in  failure and separation. Quite commonly this  leads to un-necessary and costly repairs, and in some cases,   can be life   threatening &nbsp;if&nbsp;a catastrophic failure results in an accident. Therefore it is essential to   thoroughly clean and inspect these parts  prior to reuse. If the rubber, or metal   parts, show any signs of cracking or  excessive wear, they need to be replaced. This is also a good time to inspect and replace the radiator and heater hoses, fan belts, vacuum lines, radiator cap, fuel pump and fuel filters, as well as all gaskets and seals. <br />

            <p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style4B">Log Adaptors: </span>Many inline enthusiast use aftermarket carb adaptors to install a two barrel   carb to the integral log intake, replacing the troublesome one barrel. There are many   different types of adaptors, so you'll need to make sure you purchase the   correct adaptor for your application and choice of carburetor. Depending on which carb you use, you can expect to gain a bit more bottom end and peak horsepower. The single biggest advantage to using an adaptor, is that the modification can be done without removing the cylinder head. For more information, please see the various <a href="logmods-2.html">tech articles</a> we have written on this subject. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B">Log Modifications:</span> Another method of upgrading to a 2V carburetor incorporates mounting a custom   adaptor to a modified log intake manifold, and hogging out the carb opening. This method allows the use of  Holley and Autolite   carburetors, increased hood clearance, and substantial gains in   horsepower and torque. Our dyno results showed gains up to 25HP, depending on the carb selection, over the stock 1V carb on a stock small six.  The only drawback to this method is that the intake needs to be milled flat,   which requires removing the cylinder head for machining. The intake is then   built up with a metal putty or furnace brazing, machined flat again, then hogged out for a 2V carb.  However, we feel this is a small price to pay for the gains achieved. Plus you have the opportunity to replace the camshaft while the cylinder head is off, for even greater gains in performance. It's also a great time to upgrade to a large log cylinder head. For more information, see our <a href="LogMods.html#2VC">tech article</a>. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B">Head Swaps:</span> Another popular modification is swapping to a late model cylinder head, which offers larger valves, as well as  increased intake and port volumes. The later model heads are easily spotted by the  larger log intake and a 1.75&quot; (verses 1.5&quot;) carb opening. The advantage is a substantial increase in performance due to the additional air flow available, how ever one must be careful to maintain the proper compression ratio due to the various combustion chamber sizes. Before you swap heads, spend a few more bucks to modify the intake for a direct mount 2V carb, and maybe even a little port work. For more information,  see our <a href="HeadSwap.html">tech article</a>. <br />  
              <br />
              <a name="carb" id="carb"></a><span class="style4B">Cylinder Head Options:</span> If you can find an OZ250-2V head, along with their removable 2V alloy intake manifold, you might want to seriously consider purchasing one. Even if it does stretch your budget to its very limits, or if you have to put off purchasing a set of headers or an upgraded ignition system, buy it if you stumble across one. They are getting rare and hard to come by, so you need to seize the moment if you find one that's available. You may not get a second chance. <br />
              <br />
              The advantage of the OZ 250-2V head/manifold is that it   relives the asthmatic conditions associated with the stock log head without any    modifications, or multiple carbs being adapted to the log manifold. Dyno test   have shown that a stock 200ci engine with only the OZ 250-2V head/manifold, a   two barrel carb, and headers, yielded a forty percent increase in horse power. The disadvantage is that the heads were only produced for a   few years, with production ending more than thirty  years ago, hence only used heads are   available. Due to their rarity, they are getting more expensive yearly, and normally require a full rebuild, including new guides and hardened valve seats. When purchasing one, you need to make sure the head was magnaflux'd, as they are prone to cracking. While they can be repaired to like new condition, it's expensive. Also make sure that the repair work was completed by a qualified shop, that knows how to weld cast iron properly. For more information, see our <a href="OZ250-2v.html">tech article</a>.<br />
              <br />
              Another great upgrade, though expensive, is our <a href="AlumOverview-2.html">Aluminum Cylinder Head</a>. We won't go into any details here, as this is far beyond the scope of a budget build, and because we have a great deal of information available elsewhere on our website. However we just wanted to take a moment and make you aware that an aluminum cylinder head does exist. From here, the options are endless....... <br />

              <span class="style4B">Camshaft:</span> We recommend up-grading to a mild performance cam, with a duration  in the 260-270 range, for a noticeable increase in performance over the stock camshaft. Keeping the cam in the 260-270 range maintains low end power, while dramatically increasing the top end performance. Our 264/264 single pattern cam is ideal for those  running a 2V  carb via an adaptor. Our 264/274 dual pattern camshaft is better suited to those running a direct mount 2V  carb on a modified log, however it does lower the manifold vacuum just a bit, so it may not be your best choice if you have and automatic or power brakes. The general &quot;Rule of Thumb&quot; is to use a 110-112 lobe center with automatic transmissions, and a 108-110 lobe center with a manual transmission.<br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B">Option:</span> Those who are building a 200ci block may want to  install a double roller timing chain. Unfortunately they are not available for the 250ci engines. We have looked into having them produced, but the current chains won't work with the gears. Basically if one link is removed the chains are too short, add a link and they're too long. We haven't given up yet and will keep looking for a solution until all avenues have been exhausted. We may  try to design and produce a belt drive, if we feel there's enough demand to justify the cost. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B">Option:</span> If you desire a bit more top end performance, and a little less emphasis on low end torque, our 274/274 single pattern camshaft is ideally suited. This would be my personal choice when building a mild 250ci engine, as the 250's inherently have more bottom end power to sacrifice. 
              Or if <span class="style3B">you plan to add a turbo charger</span> at a later date, we recommend using our 274/274 camshaft with a 112 lobe center, which is ideally suited for use with a mild street turbo and an 8.5:1 C/R. <br />
              <br />
              <strong>Note:</strong> We highly recommend <a href="CamDegree.html">Degreeing Your Cam</a> when it's installed, so that you can be absolutely certain that the valve timing is in correct synchronization with the crankshaft. If you are installing one of our  Clay Smith Cams, we recommend degreeing the cam with 4 degrees  of advance for the best possible performance. <br />

            <p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style4B">Valve Springs:</span> The <a href="Springs.html">valve springs</a> are one of the most critical components of your engine. It is very   important to match the camshaft and potential rpm range with the correct spring   rate.&nbsp; Stock valve springs  will float around 4500rpm, and as such   are not adequate for use with   performance camshafts. Therefore we recommend up-grading to   a valve spring such as those used for a small block V8 application (289/302). When selecting a valve spring, you don't want one with to much pressure as this wears out the valve train prematurely. On the other hand, a spring with too little pressure will float at higher rpm's, causing the valves to bounce, which also wears out the valve train prematurely. Therefore, when a stock or mild cam is used, we recommend 289 springs for motors which  normally operate in the lower  rpm range, and 302 springs for those that operate in the   higher rpm range. 
              <span class="style3Bl"><br />
              </span><br />
              <strong><a name="turbospring" id="turbospring"></a>Option: </strong>If turbo charging, you need to use a higher rate spring, such as our STY or Dual valve springs. The reason for this is that it takes  more pressure to close the valves  when the motor is under full boost at higher rpm's. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B">Rocker Assembly: </span>We recommend up-grading to an adjustable <a href="RockerOptions.html">rocker assembly</a>, if the motor doesn't already have one. This allows for proper adjustment of the rockers due to the changes in deck height and milling the cylinder head. While its not required, it may  be beneficial to up-grade to chrome-moly pushrods as well. They are lighter and stronger than regular steel push rods, and offer increased strength so they don't flex at higher rpm's,   or under the stress of higher lift cams and stiffer valve springs. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style4B"><a name="Rockopt" id="Rockopt"></a>Option:</span> According to our dyno test, up-grading to a high ratio (1.6 or 1.65) rocker assembly increases the average horse power by as much as 10-15hp, with the  largest gains in the low and mid-range rpm's, where its needed most for a daily driver or weekend cruiser.

            <p align="justify" class="style3B">            <span class="style4B">Distributor:</span>            Up-grading the ignition system is probably<span class="style4Bl"> the best modification you can make</span>, and in our opinion, the first modification that should be done. Ditching the old points style distributor in favor of an electronic distributor, offers numerous benefits, including quicker starts, a smoother idle, improved cold weather starts,  improved throttle response,  lower emissions, better gas mileage,  quicker revs, and improved performance. Tough to beat...... <br />
                <br />
              <span class="style4B">Petronics:</span> One of the cheapest and quickest upgrades is to a Petronics Ignition. While it is light years ahead of the points style distributor, it is probably our least favorite, hence we will not go into this system in any detail. The one big advantage it has, is that it maintains the stock distributor, coil, and wires, for those who prefer to keep a stock OEM appearance.  The disadvantage is that it doesn't cure the problems associated with the distributor itself. For example, if your planning a carb swap, you'll need a distributor that has centifugal counter weights. The other disadvantage is if and when the unit fails. If you don't have a spare in your glove box, odds are you're going to be left sitting on the side of the road and/or calling AAA for a tow. For more infomation, see our <a href="Pertronix.html">tech article</a>. <br />

              <span class="style4B">Duraspark II:</span><span class="style3B"> Upgrading to a <a href="DSIIswap.html">DSII Distributor</a> can be very reasonable, however much of the cost is dependant on the selection of the ignition module. The distributor, cap adaptor, cap, and rotor, will generally set you back about $75 bucks at any local parts store.  When purchasing the distributor, ask for one from a 78 Fairmont, and be sure you pick up  the cap adaptor, as well as the cap and rotor. </span>              Once you've picked up the distributor, you'll still need an ignition coil and module, for which there are many options. A high performance coil and plug wires are normally preferred, and  can be purchase online, at specialty performance shops, and most  local chain stores.
              As for the ignition module, you can purchase the stock Ford Blue-Strain module, Classic Inlines  <a href="products9408.html?cat=111">Dyna-Module</a>, an MSD-6A (or similar),  or you can  build your own box using a cheap GM 4-pin module. Cost of the ignition module will set you back anywhere from $100 bucks, up to $300 depending on which system you use. <br />
              <br />
              Wiring the DSII can be intimidating for some, however there's always plenty of help on the <a href="www.fordsix.html">FordSix forum</a> if you get stuck. However once the system is installed you'll notice a big improvement over the old points style distributor. Quicker starts, smoother idle, improved throttle response, increased mileage, and more power. <br />
              <br />
              While most chain stores stock DSII parts, many are starting to offer the distributors  as a &quot;special order only&quot; due to their age.  On the other hand,  Classic Inlines always has them in stock. We also offer a kit that includes everything you need, including the distributor, cap adaptor, cap, rotor, ignition module, coil, and wiring. Our kits also include easy to follow instructions, that show you exactly how to connect the wires. There's no guess work. <br />

Dyno results have shown the DUI to out perform both the Petronics and the Duraspark II systems, regardless of which module and/or coil is used. In two separate dyno sessions, we gained 13HP over a custom curved DSII, and 20HP over the stock distributor. While the DUI may cost more up front, long term maintenance is cheaper, and replacement parts are easily acquired from any parts store.

While we have never dyno tested the headers specifically, they are said to increase performance approximately 10-15 percent. While we personally think these numbers are a bit high, when adding just a header, it is probably fairly accurate when all of the above modifications are performed. During installation, put a liberal coat of RTV silicone on both sides of the gasket to prevent exhaust leaks. Locking header bolts may be beneficial as well, but regardless of what you use, make sure to torque the headers bolts properly. They should be torque'd down at least three times, during the install, after  running up to a normal operating temperature and cool down,  and again after four or five more cycles reaching normal operating temperatures. Always start in the middle and work outward in a circular pattern. <br />

            <span class="style4B">Exhaust Pipes: </span>For mild street motors  a 2.25&quot; exhaust pipe is adequate for a single out system, while 1.75&quot; pipes are sufficient for dual out. For performance motors, step up the diameters to  2.5&quot; for a single out, and 2.0&quot;-2.25&quot; for dual outs. Mufflers are totally a personal preference, so we won't make any recommendations here. Personally we like open headers, to bad they're illegal on the street. However there's something to be said for a really quiet muffler too (sleeper). <br />
