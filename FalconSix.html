                <td><div align="justify">Earlier in this issue we briefly covered the <a href="History.html">History of the Ford Inline  Six</a>. While the article covered all Ford inline sixes, emphasis was placed on  the &lsquo;Falcon Six&rsquo; (commonly referred to as the &lsquo;Small Six&rsquo;) due to its wide  spread use and popularity. While this engine is still known  for it&rsquo;s reliability, excellent mileage (25-30mpg),  and ease of maintenance,  it's also well known for its meager and lack luster  performance. The reason for this is quite simple, six-cylinder engines  were generally found in the lower-priced models, who&rsquo;s basic image was one of  economy, rather than performance. Yet for years there have been scores of  six-cylinder enthusiast searching for ways to increase the power output, while  maintaining the economy and reliability (which is especially true today with  the rising gas prices). Until recently, this has been a difficult task to  accomplish. However the introduction of new ideas and products over the past  few years has not only made it possible, it is largely responsible for the  Falcon Six making a strong comeback and becoming more popular than ever. </div></td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <p align="justify">While power is certainly an important factor, there are several other points to consider before  making the decision to build a performance six. One of the first and most  important considerations is cost. If your merely looking for cheap horsepower,  and not concerned with mileage, handling, or appearance, then a performance six  is probably not your best choice. While the cost of building a motor can vary  considerably, building a mild or high performance six will generally cost twice  that of a V8, based on horsepower per dollar. However if you are&nbsp; dropping a V8 into a six-cylinder vehicle,  you&rsquo;ll have the added expense of swapping the front and rear suspension (to  handle the additional weight of a V8), which offsets some of the cost of  building a six. In either case, you&rsquo;ll need to add the expense of upgrading the  drive-train, braking, and steering, which is&nbsp;  required to safely handle the additional performance. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  If you prefer a power-plant  that offers 25-30 mpg, improved handling (due to the reduced nose weight), or  one that draws a crowd at car shows, an inline six may be just what your  looking for. In a recent poll, FordSix.com forum members were asked why they  kept, and/or built their inline sixes. While the replies varied considerably,  the overwhelming majority responded by saying they wanted something other than  the normal cookie cutter V8. With the Ford V8&rsquo;s being so popular over  the past four decades, performance parts have been easy to come by and  reasonably priced. However the cupboard has been, for the most part, empty and  bare for inline enthusiast. And the parts that were available were generally  higher priced. New products are expensive to develop and produce, and when  demand is low it becomes difficult to recoup those expenses, hence the higher  prices.&nbsp; Even with the demand being  questionable, there are companies developing new products for the inline sixes.  These products are making it possible to produce more power from the small six  than ever before, sometimes equal to or more than that of a streetable V8. In  the following pages, we will introduce you to the newest products, as well as  the latest ideas and trends for &ldquo;Hopping up the Falcon Six&rdquo;. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
              To increase power you need to address the induction  and exhaust systems, combustion ratio and cam profile, and the ignition system.  A really powerful engine may need upgrades to the cooling system as well.  Unlike many small 4-cylinder engines, you don't need to buzz a small six to  7500 rpm to make power. In fact you can build substantial levels of power and  torque, at useable levels of rpm (2500-5000) for a daily driver or weekend  cruiser. Installing headers and bolting on more carburetion to an otherwise  stock engine, is a good place to start and will certainly help the performance.  However the total gains may be disappointing and only make the shortcomings of  the cylinder head, with its integral intake manifold, and the stock cam more  evident. Basically an engine is a big air pump, and as such, the modifications  must be performed systematically in order for them to work together and produce  the performance levels you desire. <br />
              <br />
            The small six was blessed with a bulletproof 7-main bottom end with  ample strength to support much higher levels of power. On the other hand, its  biggest shortcoming is its ability to breathe due to the design of the cylinder  head, which incorporates an integral log style manifold. Although this certainly saved Ford a lot of money in manufacturing  costs, it cursed these engines in terms of performance. The stock six suffers  from fuel/air distribution issues that are rooted in the integral  intake-manifold and cylinder head design. As such, the fuel doesn't atomize  consistently, which results in poor idle quality, stumbling off idle, and an  engine that is difficult to tune.</p>
            <table width="578" height="24" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="1" bgcolor="#000000">

            <br />
            <p align="justify">              To increase the power output of the small six, one must first relieve the  asthmatic conditions of the integral log cylinder head. This has been done in a  variety of ways over the years, which includes everything from modifying the  log or adding multiple carb pads, to completely removing it and fabricating a  homemade intake. Other methods include adding a triple 1V manifold on top of  the log, or using adaptors to convert to a two-barrel. While they all add power  to some degree, none of these methods has been very successful for one reason  or another. Modifying the log head or fabricating a custom intake manifold is  beyond the experience level of most shade tree or Do-It-Yourself (DIY)  mechanics, and even some professional shops. Adding a triple 1V intake, while  being a showstopper, is a nightmare for those looking for reliability and  maintenance free driving. <br />
              <br />
              The most popular method, and the easiest, is adding a  two-barrel carb by means of an adaptor which funnels the air/fuel mixture  through the existing manifold inlet. While it may add some power, it is  doubtful the gains are what one might expect, and it may lead to surging,  hesitations and flat spots at lower rpm&rsquo;s. Another popular method, which  we prefer, is to mill the top of the log intake and mount a 2V adaptor directly  to the log. Once the adaptor is mounted, the manifold is drilled, or hogged out  so that both barrels dump into the log rather than attempting to funnel the  additional flow through a hole half the size. To our knowledge neither method  which utilizes an adaptor, have been tested on a dyno, hence the questionable  gains. Legendary Fords has been informed that Classic Inlines and Pony Carbs  plan to test both methods in the very near future, therefore we&rsquo;ll be sure to  follow up and keep you posted on the results.<br />
              &nbsp;<br />
              As we mentioned in the &ldquo;History of the Inline Six&rdquo; Ford Australia had a better  idea and recast the cylinder head with a removable alloy intake. In our next  issue, we will cover the advantages of the OZ250-2V cylinder head, as well as  turbochargers, superchargers, and fuel injection. The article will cover the  various head swap options and the results of the latest dyno testing, which  include a dyno run on a naturally aspirated 200ci, that produced 211hp and  227lbs of torque at the rear wheels. We&rsquo;ll also review the two newest products  to be added to the induction arena, Pony Carbs new annular discharge one-barrel  carburetor, and Classic Inlines aluminum cylinder head and removable alloy  intake. <br />
              <br />
              Beyond induction upgrades and modifications, there are several other  areas that need attention if you want to produce more power. These include the  rod bolts and pistons, camshaft and valve train, exhaust headers, and the  ignition system. When rebuilding the short block we always recommend balancing  the reciprocating assembly. We also suggest the use of ARP rod bolts; as the  stock bolts are the weakest link in an otherwise bulletproof bottom end. For  most engine rebuilds we recommend using ARP studs for the cylinder head and  main caps as well. When you use bolts to secure the cylinder head, or caps, the  bolt is actually being &quot;<em>twisted </em>&quot; while it is being torque'd.  However when applying torque to a nut, the stud is stretched rather than  twisted, which increases the clamping force and accuracy, and applies a more  consistent torque loading. Using studs makes it easier to assemble the engine,  insuring proper alignment of the cylinder head and head gasket, and aids in the  prevention of head gasket failures which is important if you plan to add boost  to your inline six.</p>

            <br />
            One of the most common mistakes when building a performance motor is  over-camming the engine. A car that idles rough,  stalls in gear, is a bear to drive in traffic and gets poor gas mileage, is  still cool if it rocks when you floor the gas pedal. An engine that suffers  these driveability headaches and gets blown away by a Ricer is the worst  possible experience. The most prevalent reason for engines that don't run as  they should, is an improper cam profile for the engine and vehicle combination.  Everything about the engine build, drive-train components, and intended function  must be decided upon before choosing the cam. To select exactly the right  camshaft one must consider: the engine's compression ratio, the power range of  the head, the intake-manifold-carb combination, the exhaust system, the  transmission type (and/or torque converter stall speed), the rear gear ratio  and rear tire size, and the car's weight. Once you've decided how you want the  car to behave, you must build the entire engine and drive-train to suit your  needs. <br />
            <br />
            There are many numbers and terms used when describing a camshaft's design that  must be understood when choosing a cam. It's good to know exactly how each of  these specs affects the engine's performance. One of the most important  numbers, is the cams duration. Duration is how long the cam holds the valves  open. It's expressed in degrees of crankshaft rotation (remember, the cam  rotates at half the speed of the crank). A 280- degree-duration cam holds the  valves open longer than a 260-degree-duration cam. Holding the valves open  longer allows more air and fuel into the engine and allows more to get out  through the exhaust. Longer durations (higher number) improve top-end power but  almost always sacrifice low-end torque. Lower durations improve low-end torque  and make the car idle better, but limit top-end power. And you can get only so  much valve lift with a short duration cam due to the rate-of-lift limitations  of the lifter.<strong><br />
            <br />
            </strong>The most confusing thing about duration, is the difference between  &quot;advertised&quot; and &quot;at .050-lift&quot; duration. At .050-lift  duration is measured from the point where the cam moves the lifter up .050 inch  until .050 inch before the lifter is all the way back down. Most cam  manufacturers differ in where they start and finish measuring for advertised  duration. Some start at .004-inch lift, some at .008-inch and some measure it  somewhere in between. A 280 cam (advertised duration) from one manufacturer could  actually have less duration at .050 than a 278 cam from another manufacturer,  due to the different points at which companies measure advertised duration.  That's why the .050-lift numbers are the best to go by.<br />
            <br />
            The most popular cams for the Falcon six are Comp Cams H260, and  Classic Inlines H264 and H274 cams. All three are excellent street cams and  provide increase torque and horsepower over stock cam profiles. In general, a  112* lobe center is used for vehicles with automatic transmissions, while  108-110* lobe centers are used for those with manual transmissions. Since the  lobe center controls&nbsp;where the power curve is applied, changing the lobe  center from 112* to 110*, lowers the point where the cam starts working.  However, a cam with a 110* lobe center will idle rougher than one with a 112*  lobe center. A 110* lobe center will also have less vacuum, which may be  important if you have vacuum assisted brakes and/or steering. <br />
            <br />
            For motors with increased carburetion, a dual pattern camshaft is often  preferred, such as Classic Inlines 264/274 cam. A dual-pattern cam is one that  has different duration and/or lift specs for the intake and exhaust. Classic  Inlines also offers a 278* solid lifter cam, which is generally good for  15-30hp over a hydraulic cam, but keep in mind that a solid lifter cam requires  more&nbsp; regular valve adjustments. Other  cam manufacturers for the small six include: Clay Smith, Crane, Clifford  Performance, Isky, and Schneider. <br />
            <br />
            Listed below is a general group classification for aftermarket cam profiles.  The durations shown are based on .050 cam lift with a 112&deg; lobe center. The  descriptions within each group show the general characteristics of the cams in  that group, as well as any recommended modifications to the car or engine. Most  small six cams will be in the Class I and Class II groups.&nbsp; 
            <ul type="disc">
              <li><strong>Class I</strong> (200&deg; -       215&deg;)<strong><br />
              </strong>Good       idle quality with low rpm torque and mid range performance. Works well       with a stock or slightly modified engine with manual or automatic       transmissions.</li>
              <li><strong>Class II</strong> (215&deg;       - 230&deg;)<br />
              Fair idle quality with good low to mid range torque and horsepower. Works       well with stock or modified engines with manual or automatic transmission       with a mild stall converter. Lower vacuum than stock.</li>
              <li><strong>Class III</strong> (230&deg;       - 245&deg;)<br />
              Rough idle quality with good mid to high rpm torque and horsepower.       Requires improved induction, exhaust, and ignition system, plus manual       transmission or automatics with a high stall converter. Good combination       for Street and Strip, but has low vacuum.</li>

            Everyone knows that high performance engines typically have higher  compression ratios. Why, because higher compression ratios make more hp. Higher  C/R's also improve fuel efficiency and throttle response. However there are  also drawbacks to higher C/R&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Simply  put, once the C/R exceeds a certain point, detonation occurs. Detonation kills  power and it kills the engine, literally. This is especially true with a small  six, given the design of the cylinder head chamber. With that in mind, you are  probably wondering how high should your C/R be? Before you can make that  decision, or select your cam profile, you&rsquo;ll need to  know the difference between Static Compression and Dynamic Compression. It is  very important to understand these differences, and how they affect your motor  and your cam selection. If you do an internet search, you&rsquo;ll find several good  articles online. Take time to read them, and get a good understanding of  Dynamic Compression Ratios before you start building your motor or purchasing parts.  Classic Inlines has a good tech article on their website at  &ldquo;http://classicinlines.com/CompressionRatio.asp&rdquo;.<br />
            <br />
            Once you have a good understanding of Dynamic and  Static C/R, you can determine the C/R and make your cam selection. We  won't go into all the calculations required, as there are numerous programs  available for handling that chore. We recommend purchasing one of these  programs (called Cam Utility Programs) if you are going to select the camshaft  profile and C/R without the assistance of a trained professional. If your not  sure, all cam manufactures will be more than happy to assist you in selecting  the cam profile. However, with the available programs it is actually quite  simple.<br />
            <br />
            It is known that most gas engines make the best  power with a Dynamic C/R between 7.5 and 8.5 on 91 or better octane. Unless  you have actually measured the engine (CC'd the chambers and pistons in the  bores), calculations are estimations at best and need to be treated as such.  Since the published volumes for heads and pistons vary, it is best to error on  the low side. When contemplating an engine with an 8.4 DCR or higher,  measurements are essential, or you may wind up building another motor.  Generally speaking, a small six should not  exceed a SCR of 9.5:1 or a DCR of 8.4 without the use of water injection,  performance coatings, or high-octane fuels, which assist in reducing the  likelihood of detonation. <br />
            <br />
            The two of the most common methods of  raising the C/R are milling the cylinder head, and decking the block. Milling  the cylinder head surface reduces the combustion chamber size, while milling  the block (called decking) reduces the cylinder volume. Both methods increase  the compression ratio, and both methods may be use simultaneously to achieve  the desire C/R. On the 200ci block, a common practice is to zero deck the  block,&nbsp; thus making it flush with the  top of the piston. It&rsquo;s also quite common to deck a 250ci block, as the stock  deck heights were quite high. It should be noted that an increase in  compression generates more heat, therefore one need to be sure the cooling  system is in good working order. Another rule of thumb is to select a spark  plug with a heat range one step cooler, and to reduce the initial ignition  advance slightly. <br />

            <p align="justify">              Another way to increase compression is to use flat top pistons, or a piston  with a higher compression height. While the 144ci and 170ci engines (3.50 bore)  came with flat top pistons, all 200ci and 250ci engines (3.68 bore) came with  dished pistons. The dish size varied from 7cc for pre &rsquo;72 engines, to 13cc in  &rsquo;72-&lsquo;83 engines. However, you can also use flat top pistons from a 141ci  four-cylinder Tempo HSC, as they have the same bore and compression height as  the 200/250ci engines. For the 250ci you can use 255ci V8 pistons as well,  which have a compression height of 1.585&rdquo; verses 1.500&rdquo; for stock pistons. This  will raise the piston .085&rdquo; higher in the cylinder, which would be the same as  decking the block the same amount. <br />
              &nbsp;<br />
              When selecting piston rings, we recommend moly  rings over cast iron. Cast iron rings are fine for typical light duty service  where the vehicle is not subjected to long periods of high speed and is run  primarily on paved streets, or when the motor is not subjected to unusual dirt  or heat conditions. However moly (molybdenum) rings  are preferred for occasional or continuous high speed  and/or load conditions, where the engine is subject to periods of high  temperature ranges. Moly rings have a high scuff resistance, superior  strength, and improved oil control and retention, which  makes them better suited to performance engines where they are expected to  serve adequately, through-out the entire life of the engine.<br />
              All small sixes came from the factory with steel shim  head gaskets, which are no longer in production. Occasionally you can find New  Old Stock (NOS) gaskets, which are .027&rdquo; thick, however these are rare and  quite difficult to find. Therefore the only choice is to use aftermarket  composite gaskets. Victor gaskets have a compressed thickness of .045, while  Felpro and Corteco gaskets have a compressed thickness of .050, therefore it  is important to calculate the C/R based on the thickness of the gasket  selected.</p>

            You have several options for upgrading your valve train components,  including adjustable rockers, roller tipped rockers, or full roller rocker  assemblies. One proven way to increase power is by decreasing the amount of  valvetrain friction. Two of the biggest friction hot spots in any valvetrain  are those where the rocker fulcrum rides on the shaft or stud, and where the  tip of the rocker comes in contact with the valve stem. By placing a roller on  the tip of the rocker where it comes in contact with the valve stem, the rocker  is able to roll across the valve as it travels through its cycle, instead of  sliding back and forth across the valve stem. Beside the obvious friction  created here by non-roller tips, serious side loads are placed on the valve  stem as the tip drags across the top of it while the valve travels up and down  in the valve guide, resulting in excessive guide wear. <br />
            <br />
            Another time-honored way to increase power with rocker arms is to change the  ratio of the rocker. Therefore opening the valve a little further and faster,  allowing more air in and out of the engine, thus creating more power. Changing  from a rocker ratio of 1.5 to 1.6 generally adds about 3 degrees of valve  duration. The net result is you are effectively changing your cam specs without  changing your cam. <br />

            Valve springs are one of the most critical components of your engine. It is  very important to match the camshaft and potential RPM range with the correct  spring rate.&nbsp; Stock springs float around 4500rpm, and as such they are not  recommended for use with performance camshafts. As a general rule we suggest up  grading to a valve spring such as those used on small block applications  (289/302) for mild cams, and to single springs with dampers or dual springs for  high performance. <br />
            <br />
            It is said that t<strong>oo  much spring pressure is hard on valves, i</strong>n truth, what&rsquo;s hard  on valves is the speed at which they contact the valve seat when closing. What  dictates how hard the valve hits the seat? It&rsquo;s supposed to be the camshaft&rsquo;s  closing ramp (shape of the cam lobe), but when the spring pressure is too low  the valve does not follow it&rsquo;s intended path and instead slams into the seat  and actually bounces. Hence higher spring pressures can actually aid the valve  by forcing it to more closely follow the shape of the cam lobe. However to much  valve spring pressure adds un-nessacary friction, resulting in excessive valve-train wear. Therefore it is important to match the spring pressure to the  profile of the camshaft. <br />

              Dumping the stock cast iron exhaust manifold is usually the first thing  performance seekers attend to. Headers are available from several suppliers and  are offered in both single and dual out styles. Dual exhaust pipes should be  1.75&rdquo;to 2.25&rdquo; in diameter, while single pipes are normally 2&rdquo; to 2.5&rdquo; for the  best results. A port divider, which is used to split the 3rd and 4th  exhaust ports to enhance performance, once considered a requirement for upgrading  the exhaust system, has become questionable over the past few years. Many  FordSix.com forum members have installed them, only to have them break loose,  which results in a very annoying rattle. Once removed the port divider is  usually discarded, as very little difference (if any) is observed.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not clear if any testing has been done  to validate the installation of the port divider, hence future testing is  planned to verify the benefits, one way or the other.&nbsp; <br />

              Upgrading the ignition system is the easiest modification you can make,  and is considered to be the best modification on an otherwise stock engine. The  old points style ignition can be replaced with a Petronics unit, which retains  a stock appearance, or completely discarded in favor of a new or rebuilt  distributor. <br />

              Best  bang for the buck, the Duraspark II distributor is hard to beat as a triggering  devise for an electronic ignition system. Coupled with either a stock ignition  box or an aftermarket control box such as the Dyna Module or MSD-6A, it is a  tough, readily available, reliable distributor. The system consists of a  magnetic reluctor and pickup in the distributor, and an ignition module to  trigger the coil. They were offered as stock equipment and are a direct fit on both the  200ci and 250ci engines,  providing they were built after 1964 and have the 5/16&quot; oil pump drive  shaft. Pre &rsquo;64 200ci engines, as well as all 144/170ci engines, had &frac14;&rdquo;  drives. If you want to get one from the  auto parts store, make it easy on the clerk and  ask for a distributor from  a '78 or '79 Fairmont.&nbsp;<br />
              <br />
              Classic Inlines also offers a performance  Duraspark II distributor, which utilizes a full length bronze bushing&nbsp;to provide increased  durability and cure top end timing fluctuations which were common in the OEM  distributors. The Duraspark distributor can be wired to various ignition  control modules, including a GM 4-pin module, a Ford Blue Strain module, a Dyna module with the matching  Inferno coil (sold by Classic Inlines), a MSD 6A module, or similar aftermarket  ignition systems. <br />
              <br />
              Another option is a DUI Distributor sold by Classic Inlines. While the DUI is the most  expensive system, it is also the most powerful ignition system available for  the small six. Dyno testing on a 200ci engine showed an increase of 13 ponies  over the DuraSpark II and MSD combo, and 20+HP over a stock ignition  system.&nbsp;
              Manufactured by Performance Distributors, the DUI dizzy is a one-piece, high  performance ignition system with the coil and ignition module self-contained in  the distributor cap. The one wire hook-up makes it a truly clean and simple <strong>drop in</strong> installation that eliminates  all of the messy and confusing wiring associated with other ignition systems.  Unlike stock and many aftermarket systems, no ballast resistor is required,  which allows full voltage for a hotter spark and superior power. <u><br />

              Before starting any performance upgrades, honestly assess your intended  use. If you intend to use the car as a daily commuter, you probably don&rsquo;t want  a high duration solid lifter cam, high compression, and 5.30 rear gears with a  3600-stall converter! You certainly don't want to build an engine that is a  real screamer at 7000 rpm if it's going to be used in a rock-climbing Bronco,  or street driven in stop and go traffic! Keep in mind that the rest of the  drive train should match the power plant for the best results.&nbsp; Even a properly built high-performance six  may be no fun to drive if the torque converter and/or rear gears are not  matched to the engine's capabilities. Be prepared to spend those hard-earned  dollars, or accept the 200/250 for what it is and work within its capabilities.  Either way, in the end you'll be rewarded with an economical, durable, and  different alternative to V8 performance.<br />
