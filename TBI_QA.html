Factors influencing size are; power output, rpm, cylinder head design,   cylinder capacity, position of the throttle body in the inlet tract, and position   of the injector. Choice of bore size, or diameter, is a balanced compromise resulting   from the following:<br />
<br />
<strong>1)</strong> A larger bore leads to lower flow resistance, but   obeys the laws of diminishing returns.<br />
              <strong>2)</strong> A smaller bore leads to better   throttle control and response and improved fuel mixing.<br />
              <strong>3)</strong> The system should be considered, in total, from the trumpet flange   to valve head.<br />
              <strong>4)</strong> Proportioned accordingly, but never undersized. </p>

              These power figures may be increased   by up to 10% in a purpose  designed and well proportioned system. 
              As   butterfly to valve distance increases, butterfly size will need to increase in   proportion to system taper and vice versa. 
              Lower revving engines, and those   with injectors placed before the butterfly, will generally accept a larger body. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="length" id="length"></a><strong class="style6B">What is the correct overall system length?</strong> <br />
              Induction length is one of the most important aspects of fueling   performance engines. <br />
              Experiences shows an under-length system is the   greatest cause of disappointment, with losses up to 1/3 of power potential.   There are a number of good books on the subject and the serious developer is   referred to these and in particular, dyno trials.<br />
  <br />
              A guide figure, from the face   of the trumpet to the center of the valve head, is 350mm (13.78&quot;) for a 9,000 RPM engine.   Other RPM's are proportional (for 18,000 RPM the figure is 175mm).
              Any   air feed system to an air box or filter can have a large effect on the power   curve and must be considered carefully, particularly if the air box is small. 
              The induction system is part of a resonant whole, from air inlet or trumpet   to exhaust outlet, and the ideal length is heavily influenced by the other   components. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="positions" id="positions"></a><strong class="style6B">What is the best position for the   butterfly?</strong> <br />
              The butterfly is an important aid to fuel mixing. When   positioned too close to the valve this advantage will be lost, while positioning   far away may lead to a loss of response. 
            As with the injector position (see   below), higher RPM's demand a larger butterfly to valve distance. A practical   minimum figure for a 7-9,000 RPM engine is 200mm (7.875&quot;), while the maximum is   dictated by the need to fit an air horn of reasonable length to achieve a good   overall tract shape. </p>
            <p align="justify">One solution to this apparent compromise is the use of   bodies with fully-tapered bores which, in effect, extend the trumpet distance   beyond the butterfly and into the manifold. For very high speeds above   approximately 15,000 RPM, the ideal butterfly position is only just inside, or   even outside the trumpet and a point is reached where a taper is no longer   sufficient for good tract shape. For these circumstances we can supply bodies   with the exponential trumpet shape machined into them as a special service, or   barrel bodies which, by their nature, must be purpose-designed in conjunction   with the cylinder head. <br />
              <br />
              <a name="Type" id="Type"></a><strong class="style6B">Which type of throttle body?</strong> <br />
                <strong>Twin   bodies</strong> are the most straight forward solution for production engines,   Direct-to-head where available, or via a suitable manifold. <br />
                <strong>Direct-to-head-bodies</strong> represent the simplest and neatest solution.   They are harder to match to the inlet ports, if this is required for the engine   in question, but have the advantage of being angled for best results, unlike a   carburetor manifold. <br />
                <strong>Single bodies</strong> represent the no-compromise   solution, particularly for competition use. The separate manifold is easily   matched to the inlet ports and the best mixture path is guaranteed. They are   also available in fully-tapered bore and twin injector types. Mounting, balance,   and maintenance are naturally more involved. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="Ipos" id="Ipos"></a><strong class="style6B">Where is the best place for the injectors?</strong> <br />
              Where one injector is to be used per cylinder the best compromise position   is immediately downstream of the butterfly. This gains maximum advantage from   local turbulence and gives results surprisingly close to the optimum at both   ends of the rev-range. This is the recommended position for most applications.<br />
  <br />
              For performance at low RPM, economy and low emissions the injector needs to   be close to the valve and firing at the back of the valve head. This is the   favored position for production vehicles. <br />
  <br />
              For higher RPM (8,000+) the injector needs to be near the intake end of the   induction tract to give adequate mixing time and opportunity. The higher the   RPM, the further upstream the injector needs to be. As a result, use of speeds   above approximately 11,000 RPM may give best results with the injector mounted   outside the inlet tract altogether (see our remote injector mounting). <br />
  <br />
              It is   common to fit both lower and upper injectors in such a system to cover starting   and low RPM as well as high speeds. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="Itype" id="Itype"></a><strong class="style6B">Which type of injector should be used?</strong> <br />
                <strong>Dimensions:</strong> All Jenvey injector mountings and fuel rails will accept   either the standard 'O' ring mounted injectors for 14mm bores as supplied by   Bosch, Weber, Lucas, etc (64mm between 'O' ring centers) or the shorter 'Pico'   style injectors (38mm between 'O' ring centers). <br />
                <br />
              There are a number of other   injector types, using the same 'O' rings but with different lengths. These can   be used on our twin throttle bodies with ease, but may require different <a href="accss1.html#FuelRails" class="style3B">fuel rail mountings</a> on individual bodies. Please   specify which you are using when ordering throttle bodies and fuel rails. <br />
  <br />
  <strong>Flow-rate:</strong> When fitting our throttle bodies to an otherwise standard   engine bear in mind that increased power means increased fuel demand, therefore the   original equipment injectors are usually inadequate. <br />
  <br />
  <a name="allparts" id="allparts"></a><strong class="style6B">What is required for a complete fuel   injection system?</strong> <br />
              Besides throttle bodies, linkage and manifold (if   required) typical components are; A <a href="TBI_Tech.html">management system</a>,   wiring loom, fuel pump, fuel pressure regulator, fuel injectors, appropriate   plumbing, air horns and a ducting/filtration system for   the incoming air. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="manifold" id="manifold"></a><strong class="style6B">Which type of manifold design is best?</strong> <br />
              When injecting   into the throttle body (e.g. our types TB, TH, TF, TA, Direct-to-head and SF, SS   or ST//1), most of the mixing occurs within the manifold section. It is   therefore important that the manifold is suitably proportioned to evenly   accelerate gas speed and thus help fuel mixing and distribution. The straighter   the run in to the ports the better. A manifold which curves in the same   direction as the valve throats is preferred to one which causes the flow to pass   through an &quot;S&quot; bend. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="TPtype" id="TPtype"></a><strong class="style6B">Which throttle potentiometers  fit Jenvey   bodies?</strong> <br />
              We use a relatively popular mechanical interface for the   throttle potentiometer.  Popular types are; Colvern   CP17 series (as supplied by Classic Inlines), Spectrol, and  Weber (via an adapter). A number of production car throttle   pots (e.g. Rover K series) will also fit directly to the bodies. 
              The Colvern   CP17 throttle potentiometer may be mounted to either end of most installations   and spindle rotation is typically 82 degrees. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="AHorns" id="AHorns"></a><strong class="style6B">Which is the best air horn design - Trumpet/Stack/Bellmouth?</strong> <br />
              The air horn serves three main purposes; 1) To convert   the pressure difference between bore and entrance into air velocity with the   minimum of energy loss. 2) To act as the interface between the induction system   and the atmosphere, i.e. the point at which pressure waves change sign and   direction. 3) To complete the system to the required overall length. <br />
  <br />
              For   ease of description the air horn may be considered in two parts; the &quot;flare&quot; and   the &quot;tube&quot;. 
              
              The main job of the flare is to spread the low pressure zone   over the largest possible area, to reduce local pressure reduction whilst   guiding incoming air into the tube with minimum disruption or induced vortices.   The flare should be shaped to encourage air to enter from the sides, but not   from the rear, of the mouth. This is achieved by either finishing the mouth with   a sharp edge when the arc is a little beyond 90 degrees from the air horn axis   or by folding material back parallel to the axis when the arc is at, or just   below, 90 degrees to the axis. <br />
                <br />
              The main job of the tube is to accelerate the   airflow smoothly and progressively. This is best achieved by an exponential   shape - i.e. one where the radius of curvature is increasing constantly until   the angle of the sides matches the next part of the system, usually the throttle   body. At the intake end this should blend smoothly with the flare. <br />
              It should   be noted that the requirements for fuel injection and carburetion do not always   coincide and the best horns for one may not suit the other.

              Jenvey bodies can generally be used with boosts up to 80psi, although we   recommend that you contact our technical department if boost of more than 35psi or temperatures above 150&ordm;C are expected since some models require special   treatment for high pressures and/or temperatures. </p>
            <p align="justify"><a name="ACV" id="ACV"></a><strong class="style6B">Can Jenvey bodies be connected to an Air Bypass   valve?</strong> <br />
              Components and complete kits are available to connect the output   from an ABV to throttle bodies. For more information, see &quot;<a href="TBI_AB.html">Using an Air Bypass Valve</a>&quot;.  </p>
            <h2 align="justify" class="style6B"><a name="butterflies" id="butterflies"></a>Butterflies, barrels or slides?<br />
              <span class="style3B">20 years ago, carburetors and mechanical fuel injection were the only choice to   fuel a racing car engine. Selection of air valve type was simple and   apparently carved in stone; carburetors used butterflies and injection used   slide throttles. Motor Bikes and their history are a special case but what   follows is true for any performance 4-stroke petrol engine.<br />
                <br />
                  With the advent of electronic fuel injection and a more adventurous (better   funded) approach from the leading engine designers, it was discovered that   butterflies, whilst sometimes (but not always) giving slightly less power than   slides, inevitably gave better lap times. The explanation was simple;   butterflies give more progressive throttle control, improved transient   conditions, and aid mixture quality throughout the RPM range.<br />
  <br />
                As a result of these discoveries most (possibly all) of the leading car race   engine manufacturers switched to using butterflies. Lap times continued to   tumble, but there was a problem brewing for the future.</span> <span class="style3B">As peak RPM increased year by year, the required induction system length   reduced. At the same time, the ideal butterfly to valve distance increased. Over about   15,000 rpm, the ideal butterfly position falls outside the induction system -   clearly useless. Enter the barrel. <br />
  <br />
                    The barrel has some, but not all of the attributes of a butterfly. Opening is   reasonable progressive and, like the butterfly, it is easily packaged. The great   advantage is that it can be made as a continuation of the port shape, regardless   of profile (slides would overlap), and thus be placed near or even in the   cylinder head, allowing for a very short system to suit the 18,000+ RPM which is   now common. Any compromises (poor idle control, tendency to stick, poor flow   vector control, etc.) were once believed to be offset by the sheer power   available at these RPM, although once again most of the leading   car race engine manufacturers (e.g. F1) had switched back to using butterflies   by 2006. It follows that barrels on a sub 15,000 RPM engine will suffer from the   compromises without gaining the possible benefits.<br />
  <br />
                    The main advantage of the barrel - maintenance of port profile - can be   obtained by using fully profiled butterflies. These are made to precisely fit   the port profile and are shaped in cross-section to achieve the required   characteristics; minimum drag, controlled turbulence or whatever else best suits   the application. This is now the preferred solution for top-end engines used in   Formula 1, World Super Bikes and some sports-racing engines. Jenvey Dynamics   supply these for specific applications since they must be designed to suit the   engine and cylinder head used. </span><br />
  <br />
  <span class="style3B">In summary; 
    Butterflies are best wherever they can   be used. Jenvey Dynamics have a design and make service for engine  specific   profiled butterfly bodies. 
    Barrels are suitable only for engines   running at over 15,000 RPM and must be designed to suit a particular engine   type. Jenvey Dynamics have a design and make service for engine - specific   barrel bodies. 
    Slide throttles are best reserved for classics, if the   rules prohibit a change. <br />
  </span><br />
  <span class="style3B">In a back-to-back comparison, using a   Rover K series engine in race trim, Jenvey road going butterfly bodies were   found to give significantly more power at all RPM when tested against barrels. Full race butterfly bodies would further increase the margin.   Whilst the power improvements are unlikely to be found in all engine types, the   performance gains almost certainly will. </span></h2>
            <p align="justify"><strong class="style6B"><a name="singleTB" id="singleTB"></a>Why not just use a big single throttle body?</strong><br />
              The choice of throttle body size for the typical road car is a compromise   between two opposing needs; to allow sufficient air flow for the engine to   achieve its full power potential and to keep the butterfly small enough to allow   a progressive throttle action at low openings. </p>
            <p align="justify">The engine designer has a number of tricks available to help match these   opposing needs: the no. 1 solution is to use a linkage which favorably varies   the ratio between pedal movement and throttle action. For example, our SFG (big   single) throttle body rotates the butterfly 1.4 degrees for the first 10 degrees   of quadrant rotation (5.5mm of cable travel) and 20 degrees for the last 10   degrees of quadrant rotation. Other solutions include shaping the bore of the   throttle body such that the gap on one side of the butterfly remains small for   the first part of butterfly rotation, using two butterflies opening sequentially   and electronic throttle control. </p>
            <p align="justify">The above techniques allow the designer to use a sufficiently large throttle   body bore that rarely limits engine performance to a measurable degree. It   follows that enlarging the original throttle body will only make a useful gain   when other aspects of the engine have been changed to substantially increase the   power output. The most likely change due to a larger throttle body, if any, on   an otherwise standard engine is a car that goes slower round corners due to lack   of fine throttle control for the driver. At best, there may be a slight   improvement in response (see below). </p>
            <p align="justify">It helps to understand the relationship between size and output to consider   that a 2L Formula 3 engine produces 200+BHP through a 26mm (531 sq mm)   restrictor, whilst, say, a 75mm throttle body is eight times larger at 4,418 sq   mm! Similarly, in an experiment to curb the power of 270 BHP touring car   engines, we reduced the size of the single throttle body to less than 44mm (1520   sq mm) before there was any noticeable reduction: a 75mm body has three times   the flow. </p>
            <p align="justify">The single throttle body has a number of benefits for the mass-producer: it   requires no balancing or fine-tuning since all cylinders are drawing from a   common volume. It is also cheaper to make than multiple bodies and, for everyday   motoring, has the advantage that throttle response is gentle and delayed since   sudden opening of the throttle must first fill the entire induction system   before the engine gets the full benefit. This effect is well suited to the needs   of the inexpert driver since, whatever the throttle position, torque builds   slowly and nothing happens suddenly. </p>
            <p align="justify">Multiple throttle bodies are used in all naturally-aspirated true race   engines, most motorbikes and some top-end cars (e.g. BMW M series): i.e. where   the driver prefers to be in full control. They have a number of advantages: The   most obvious to the driver is virtually instantaneous throttle response whilst   the individual inlet tracts allow true length tuning of the inlet system &ndash; a   large influence on torque and power output. In a well-designed throttle body   system the positioning of the injectors and butterflies aid fuel mixing: very   important in higher RPM (i.e. above 5,000) engines. </p>
