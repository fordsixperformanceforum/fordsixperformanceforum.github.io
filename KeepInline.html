                            <br />
                      But got sick of keeping up with the Jones'   (someone is always faster), so now I just diverge. Way more fun and way less   money. (and w/ the turbo, I'm keeping up ok despite my best efforts). If you   build a V8 car, there is always another V8 car that is faster, better, and   cooler that someone will compare it to. With the 6, you are the king of your   castle... very rarely is there someone around with a 6 that you can compare to,   and if there is - it's usually someone from this forum and you know them   already. <br />
                      <br />
                      So it takes the &amp;^&amp;* measuring out of the car hobby. No   one will try to compare you to the multitude of better funded cars out there   'cause you're &quot;just a six&quot;. - That's fine by me... and then when people see that   you have done some unique, inspirational, and EFFECTIVE things to your six, they   really get stoked, and really are willing to dish out the praise - It let's you <span class="style3R">run in your own class as opposed to trying to run w/ the herd. </span><br />
                      <br />
                      My car is   way cooler than some gay bellybutton V8 muscle car anyway's. At least I think so   - and that's all that matters. Instead of sitting here browsing through summit   trying to decide which cookie-cutter bolt-on to add next (which of these 5000   different intake manifolds should I use?), I am constantly using my brain (and   this forum) to devise solutions to the problems the car gives me, because the   off-the-shelf solution to those problems doesn't exist. If I had a V8 car right   now, I would just throw dollars at it and have it working perfect. No thinking   needed. Where is the fun in that? I've done that before, but it was more fun   'cause I had less dollars, and that dictated more thinking. Now that I am   fortunate enough to have a little more money for the hobby, having a   bastard-child of a motor forces me to use my brain, and not just my wallet. <br />

It might be interesting for you to do a poll on uses. Like;   street driven only, daily driver, sunny day driver, track only, street and   occasional track, and maybe some other uses.

                      *Required ingenuity and problem solving skills- there is no cookie cutter   solution to blindly follow. Our engines require some thought and problem solving   skills partly because we are rare, and partly because commercial solutions are   scarce. <br />
                      *Satisfaction- Take a grungy, lowly six and make it look good and   run better than when it left Henry's garage. Aw, that feels good! <br />
                      *Reasonably economical- not only in mileage, but in building and   maintaining. By that I mean swapping and upgrading parts, scrounging parts,   modifying parts. Our projects are comparable to a 10,000 piece jig-saw puzzle.   You don't have to do it all at once. You can do some now, and some more later.   With a plan, you can add parts or modify as your time and budget will allow.   Progress and satisfaction can come a little at a time. <br />

                      <br />
                      Economy is important to me to a point. (I   won't be driving a Prius anytime soon, but I'd consider driving an Escape hybrid   if I didn't dislike SUV's so much) <br />
                      <br />
                      Performance is important to me to a   point. I don't race or even like any form of racing, even being next to someone   at a stoplight whose pants are figuratively on fire.. but I do love enthusiastic   driving. My area is perfect for it, with dozens or even hundreds of miles of   little-used roads. <br />
                      <br />
                      Appearance is probably the least important, but still   somewhat important. I want something that I like the look of, even if only half   a dozen people aside from myself ever get to look under the hood. I'm not a   show-off. I could easily drop 30 grand or more tarting up my Fairmont and never   let anyone (aside from friends and family) know what I've done outside of   obvious exterior changes.. but I want what I see under the hood to please me. As   an example of how I feel about appearance vs. appearances, if that makes sense:   My ideal car is an Aston Martin DBS, but only driven at night on rural roads. <br />
                      <br />
                      To be different.. that's a funny one. Yes, I want to be different.. but   I don't care whether or not most people know I'm being different. <br />
                      <br />
                      Mainly I just love the inline 6.. especially Ford I6s.. but any   decent non-Chevy I6 (or V12, if you think of it as two I6s stuck together) would   do. I'd consider owning something like a Supra or BMW M3 to enjoy a good I6, if   I didn't have ambitious plans for the I6 already in my driveway. I'd even love   to get to a point where I had enough money to start my own company to design and   build unusual engines so I could build (among other things) a W18 consisting of   3 I6s sharing a crank. Anyway, I have plenty of V8s laying around, and I may   even build them as well.. but the project that gets the lion's share of my   attention is the I6 project. <br />
                      <br />
                      I'll be very interested in what   products you offer for the small Ford I6s. I'm still hoping to stuff a turbo/EFI   250 into my Fairmont soon. I'm definitely interested in the new head, for   example. Assuming all else goes to plan, and the economy doesn't get to Great   Depression levels of awfulness, I should be starting my main project within the   next 12 months.<br />

                      Well, to be completely honest I almost   didn't. My original plan for the 6 cylinder was to rip it out and drop a V-8   into the convertible.  I had been   hanging out on VMF. My first post was how to go about pulling the 6   out and putting in an 8. The best laid plans. </p>
                        <p align="justify">What  convinced me to   stay six was one day, after I had owned the car for about 2 months, I went to a   local show and shine. At the time, my engine bay was stock. Nothing fancy,  in fact I was kind of ashamed. When I pulled into the parking   lot, I kept the hood closed. Then people started asking what I had under the   hood and I kept answering &quot;Just a Six&quot;. Out of the 40 cars there, I was the only   car with less then 8 cylinders. Finally, a few of them  convinced me to pop the hood. I had more people coming to check out my   200 then any of the other engine bays.... and that's with it looking like   crap. <span class="style3R">That's when I realized that people were tired of seeing V-8s. </span><br />

                      Late model 5.0 or 351, EFI, T5, disc brakes all around,   modernized steering, IRS rear end, 3 point belts, upgraded seats with   headrests, you name it, that was the plan. I had owned a 65 mustang with a 6   and an auto and it was a dog, and i didn't really want anything to do with that   this time around. <span class="style3R">Then the strangest thing, I realized everything I   wanted to do to the car was handling oriented, and I started to get concerned   with how that extra weight and power would affect driveability. </span><br />
                      <br />
                      I remembered an   old magazine my boss lent me in 1990, HRM's mustang magazine number 3. So 
                      I started looking around for that kind of information, and ran across   Mustangs and Fords November issue (sammie hagar on the cover), and that lead me   here. <br />
                      <br />
                      I became convinced that I could get all the power I need out of a   six and a stick, and still am. The Mustang unfortunately will have to go, since I   bought a convertible 64 falcon.<a href="#Questions" class="style2R"><br />

                      The strongest one came to   me while I was standing there, with the hood off. First start after I had gotten   it. It was hooked up to an external tank, and my friend was in it, ready to turn   the key. I told him to go for it, and the car cranked, and cranked, and cranked   until this giant hunk of iron, made in 1965, and nothing mechanically changed   since then, breathed life for the first time in 20 years. <br />
                      <br />
                      I had thought   about a V8 swap. But I watched this car struggle to life, and I couldn't   entertain the thought of tossing the motor aside. It was telling me that it had   seen 43 years of service, and still had stories to tell. <br />

                      <span class="style3R">The Beatles and   the Stones were the newest, coolest things when it was made. The Moon was still   4 years away. The Vietnam war was just starting in earnest. Gas was still less   than 50 cents a gallon. </span><br />
