            This article was complied from numerous articles and resources found on the internet, as well as our own experiences. The purpose of this article is to cover the basics things you'll need to know to make your Weber carbs run properly.&nbsp; For more detailed information, please refer to the  &ldquo;Weber Factory Tuning Manual&rdquo; which is published by <strong>Haynes</strong>. </p>
            <p align="justify">            Triple  Weber carbs offer an unparalleled experience, with throttle response and  mid-range torque being second to none. The first thing most people notice when  they go to multiple Weber&rsquo;s, beyond performance and appearance, is the ability  to finely tune, or dial in the induction system. </p>

            <p align="justify">Weber  carburetors were designed to be totally adaptable, to any size engine, for any  purpose, at any altitude. There is a natural tendency for Weber-carbureted  engines to idle smoother, particularly with a hot camshaft that may have idled  roughly beforehand. Weber carbs also have a tendency to suppress detonation or  pinging caused by uneven fuel distribution, which is a common characteristic of  conventional log manifolds that distribute fuel from a central plenum chamber.  This uneven fuel distribution causes the outer two cylinders to run lean,  creating excessive cylinder heat which can lead to pre-ignition and detonation.  The only way to eliminate these lean cylinders, is to distribute the fuel  perfectly and evenly, to each and every cylinder. <br />
  &nbsp;<br />
  The only  way one can achieve perfect fuel distribution is by using multiple carbs or  fuel injection. In fact, multi-carb induction systems respond to the gas pedal  in a manor very similar to fuel injection. This is because both systems  normally have short isolated intake runners, with a small mass of fuel/air to  move when the throttle is cracked open. This is attributed to the  independent-runner manifold, which does not incorporate a plenum chamber. In a  typical multi-carb layout, one barrel directly feeds each cylinder, without any  intercommunication between the barrels or cylinders. This &quot;isolated  runner&quot; design ensures that each cylinder is fed exactly the same as the  next, without any chance of charge-robbing or over-feeding any one cylinder.  What you are doing, in effect, is separately tuning each cylinder, or carb, to  achieve perfect fuel distribution. <br />
  <br />
  Even with all their advantages, multi-carb induction systems are not for  everyone. The reason for this is usually two fold, higher cost and/or increased  complexity (or should we say fear).&nbsp;  Lets discuss cost first. This type of induction unit represents a  sizeable investment. In order to install triple Weber's on a small six, you'll  need to purchase an OZ 250-2V cylinder head, or our aluminum cylinder head. You  also need to purchase three side-draft carbs, air filters, linkage, fuel pumps  and/or regulators, fuel lines, gauges, and an appropriate <br />
  <br />
&nbsp;The price of opening up a box and  pulling out a Weber unit with all the right pieces and associated hardware will  run you about $4,200.00. But consider that all things are relative, and that  you get what you pay for.&nbsp; In the end,  it all boils down to what you want your car to represent. As they say, &quot;the  fun's in the driving&quot;. Weber carburetion offers much more than something  that's exciting to look at. Every time you take that machine of yours down the  road, the throttle response, quick acceleration and overall flexibility are  constant reminders of what you've spent your money on: the ultimate carburetion  system.</p>
            <p align="justify">            The reason Weber's are so  well-suited to road racing is that they make so much more power over the entire  rpm range. This is a perfect characteristic for street-driven cars. When you  think about it, you spend very little time at the upper end near redline, like  the drag cars do. And while making all that midrange power, what you also have  is an engine that revs really fast. It takes on a whole different personality.</p>
            <p align="justify">Remember, you're not asking that  cylinder to gulp the mixture from a big plenum area; that's a lot of mass, by  comparison. The only air mass to move is what's in one short runner. The main  difference between fuel injection and Weber carburetion is that one relies on  fuel being injected under very high pressure, while the other responds to the  needs of the engine via the depression principle (air velocity in the  carburetor based on its venture size).            However, this carburetor was  intended for serious tuners and performance enthusiasts who want the most out  of their engine and know how to work with them.</p>

            <p align="justify">In order to get driveability,  throttle response, and lots of torque from a Weber carb, the choke size (cfm)  is the first consideration. It&rsquo;s the heart of the matter. How big is the motor,  what's the compression ratio, and what are you going to do with it? Once the  correct size choke has been selected for your application, the jetting for all  the circuits can be calculated around that choke size. If you change the chokes  (which changes the cfm), you must also change the jetting.</p>
            <p align="justify">For the sake of simplicity, let's  look at the Weber carburetor as having three basic circuits: the idle circuit,  the accelerator pump circuit, and the main circuit.<br />
                <br />
                <span class="style4B">THE IDLE CIRCUIT</span><br />
              The idle circuit is comprised of two components, the idle jet and the idle jet  carrier. With these two pieces, the tuner can meter the right proportion of  fuel and air at idle &mdash; and during low rpm operation. The idle mixture is  delivered as a pre-mixed fuel/air mixture, and the total volume is regulated  with the idle mixture screw located on the lower part of each carburetor  barrel.<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
              If the idle circuit is correctly jetted, the mixture screws on an independent  runner Weber system are usually never more than 1-1/2 turns out from closed (in  the old days it was 3/4 turn, but nowadays, the oxygenates and ethanol in our  gas requires extra richness). So if you have to open the mixture screws more  than that, it&rsquo;s time to heavy-up the idle circuit. So even though it idles  okay, going more than 1-1/2 turns out tells you the jet is basically lean (and  you're usually going to have a driveability problem), which brings us to the  next part of the idle jet's function&hellip;<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
              The idle jets in the Weber aren&rsquo;t just for idling. The idle circuit is actually  the low-speed circuit and must carry the engine all the way up to about 2,500  rpm, where the transition to the main circuit take place. That means if you  don't drive over 2500 rpm, you're only running on the idle jets. After 2500 rpm  or so, the idle circuit is entirely bypassed and no longer has anything to say.  So, if you have a driveability issue, like a stumble, or rough spot that  &quot;goes away&quot; after about 2500 rpm, that tells you to spend time  tweaking the idle circuit. Or maybe the opposite is true. Either way, the two  circuits are completely separate, so isolating the problem is fairly simple.<br />
  <br />
              As mentioned above, one the most common &quot;gremlins&quot; with Weber  carburetors is a seemingly incurable and very annoying flat spot shows up  anywhere between 2,200-2,800 rpm. This condition is generally caused by one of  two things. Either the wrong emulsion tube is in the carburetor, which is  causing a rich stumble due to an under-emulsified mixture at that particular  rpm range, or the idle circuit is falling off too early and not carrying the  engine up to the point where the main circuit takes over. When that happens, it  leaves a &quot;lean hole&quot; that feels like a stumble.<br />
  <br />
              In the case of the wrong emulsion tube, there are really only a few that work  really. If you aren't using one of them, it&rsquo;s a big part of the problem. If the  flat spot is still there even with the correct emulsion tube, then you'll need  to richen up the idle circuit. This is sometimes a tricky area, because the  first thing you want to do is throw in a bigger idle jet, but sometimes playing  with air bleeds, mixture screws, or choke sizes can accomplish the same thing  while sticking with the original jet size. A little experience comes in handy  here.<br />
  <br />
              Seeking some sound advice can save a lot of time and aggravation. Driveability  problems can be solved with a little tuning on your own or by relating the  symptoms to someone who is knowledgeable enough to help you. Remember, these  carburetors will do just about anything you want them to, as long as you know  how to work with the symptoms.<br />
  <br />
              <span class="style4B">ACCELERATOR PUMP CIRCUIT</span><br />
              The accelerator pump circuit, just like on any carburetor, is responsible for  eliminating &quot;bog&quot; and making a passing maneuver without a hesitation  or stumble. This circuit also has two basic calibration elements: the pump  exhaust valve and the pump jet. The pump exhaust is a bypass valve located in  the bottom of the float bowl. This is the piece that regulates how much fuel  you want to make available when you need that pump shot. Putting a bigger  bypass hole in the valve allows more fuel to bleed back into the float bowl  instead of out of the shooters. The smaller the hole, the more fuel you're  making available. You can even put in a &quot;closed&quot; bypass for drag  racing, when you need all the gas you can get. The duration of the pump shot is  varied by installing a larger or smaller pump jet (shooter). Larger pump jets  give a heavy blast over a short period, while the smaller ones will give a  finer, longer-duration shot.<br />
  <br />
  <span class="style4B">THE MAIN CIRCUIT</span><br />
              The main circuit is the easy one. This is where you make your power. This  circuit has three primary elements you should concern yourself with: the main  jet itself, the emulsion tube, and the air corrector. You probably thought the  main jet was all there is. In a conventional carburetor, you&rsquo;d be right. But  these are not &rsquo;t conventional carburetors.<br />
  <br />
              The main jet is stuck into the  bottom of the emulsion tube and sits in fuel. As the carburetor begins to work,  the main jet meters the amount of fuel allowed to pass through it and up into  the emulsion tube. Air enters the top of the emulsion tube through the air  corrector which meters the amount of air to be mixed with the fuel coming in  from the main jet. The air blows out of the emulsion tube through a series of  holes along its length and aerates the fuel as it rises up the well around the  tube. This emulsified mixture is then sucked out of the main delivery nozzle as  the velocity in the carburetor increases. This usually occurs by 2500 rpm or  so, and once that main circuit comes on, you&rsquo;re off like a rocket.<br />
  <br />
              Tuning the main circuit for maximum power is something that can be done by a  series of road tests and a handful of jets. The simple rule of thumb for  jetting Weber carburetors is, if you want to implement a change over the entire  rpm range, you play with the main jet. If you want to change the way the car  feels at the high end, that's more the domain of the air corrector. Also, you  should keep in mind that the air corrector is a finer adjustment than the main  jet. One step upward in the main jet (richer) equals about the same as three  steps down on the air (less air: richer).<br />
  &nbsp;<br />
              A change of air corrector would be appropriate if the engine pulls strong to  5,000 rpm and then lays down before the redline. In that case, I&rsquo;d drop the air  corrector about three sizes, and you'd probably be able to buzz the engine  right up to 7,000 rpm. If it feels sour all the way up, then I&rsquo;d go one or two  sizes heavier on the mains only. It&rsquo;s not rocket science. So what&rsquo;s so hard  about jetting Weber's? Obviously, nothing if you understand how they work.<br />
              <span class="style4B"><br />
              TUNING AND MAINTENANCE</span><br />
              A Weber carburetion system must be synchronized so each carburetor is doing  exactly the same as the rest. The synchronization procedure is done with a  Unisyn or a Synchromer (a necessary tool that should always be supplied with  any new V8 Weber system). It can either be a breeze or a nightmare, depending  on whether you have a well-designed linkage system or not. The secret to a good  linkage setup is that it must allow independent adjustment of each carburetor  without affecting all the rest as you go through the procedure, and there  should be a &quot;master idle speed screw&quot; to raise or lower the rpm of  the engine without disturbing any of the settings of the individual  carburetors. The master idle speed screw acts on the entire linkage system as a  whole. So, if someone tells you Weber's are absolutely impossible to  synchronize, question the linkage. Chances are, it's a mess and it's fighting  itself.<br />
  <br />
              The final idle mixture adjustment  for each barrel is a simple adjustment performed by ear, but for some reason, a  lot of people feel intimidated because there are three carburetors. It's done  exactly the same way you adjust the mixture on a two barrel or four barrel  carb, except with Weber's you can listen to each cylinder, one at a time. So,  while it may take you three times longer, it's not three times harder.<br />
  <br />
              Each mixture screw, as it is  turned, will have a noticeable effect on engine rpm; the wrong setting will  cause the cylinder to &quot;go away&quot;, almost like if you pulled a plug  wire. No matter how hard you try, you can't mess this up if you remember one  thing: always start from scratch with the screw seated, and then come out  between 3/4 and 1-1/2 turns. That&rsquo;s the correct starting point. From there,  turn the screw 1/8 of a turn either way and listen carefully. This method will  always get you out of the woods if you get lost. If the mixture screws want to  be out more than 1-1/2 turns, the jetting should be made richer.<br />
  <br />
              Once the  unit is synchronized and the idle mixtures are dialed-in to give you the  smoothest possible idle, you can hang up your synchronizing tool and  screwdriver, because now it's set, and when it's set, it's SET. They will not  suddenly &quot;go out&quot; on you and become unsynchronized. For some reason,  it&rsquo;s one of the stories we&rsquo;ve all heard a hundred times&hellip;that they constantly go  out of adjustment. That is absolutely not true; they do not.<br />
  <br />
              <span class="style4B">CAMSHAFT LOBE CENTERS</span><br />
              Any cam is fine  as long as you pay attention to the lobe separation angle. A 110-112 degree  lobe separation is ideal for Weber's. I generally discourage the use of anything  tighter, like 108, or 106. The problem with a lot of overlap is that it causes  &quot;reversion&quot; (reverse pulses) from the exhaust stroke that have  nowhere to go but up into the carburetor. This disturbs high rpm airflow and  causes the engine to think it's too lean at high rpm&rsquo;s. Without a plenum, the  manifold flow columns are pushed backward, up into the carburetors.<br />
  <br />
            <span class="style4B">MISC NOTES</span><br />
            Your float setting is  critical beyond words. We need to confirm that they are all set to factory  specs. If that remains an unknown, re-jetting won't correct a driveability,  leaking, or richness problem. In addition, your ignition timing is a huge  component, and if set wrong, can create serious heat in the block contribute to  percolation of fuel, and make the engine sluggish and rough, so the timing must  also be set properly. Lastly, your fuel pressure and the type of regulator you  are running are extremely important. <br />
