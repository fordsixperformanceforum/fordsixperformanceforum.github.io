          <strong class="style6B"><a name="basics" id="basics"></a>Basics of engine management</strong><br />
Modern engine management   systems do a fine job of ensuring that engines run cleanly and efficiently in a   wide variety of conditions. They are for the most part reliable and require   little or no maintenance. However they seem from the outside to be fearsomely   complicated systems which defy all attempts at understanding. Amidst all this   apparent hokum it is easy to lose sight of the two basic functions performed by   an EMS.<br />
<br />
<strong>To meter fuel to the engine in the right quantity<br />
To   provide a spark at the right time</strong><br />
<br />
<a name="whatems" id="whatems"></a><strong class="style6B">What is an engine   management system?</strong><br />
<br />
An <strong>EMS </strong>is a self-contained custom-built   computer which controls the running of an engine by monitoring the engine speed,   load and temperature and providing the ignition spark at the right time for the   prevailing conditions and metering the fuel to the engine in the exact quantity   required.<br />
<br />
There are two discrete subsystems in operation within the EMS -   the fuel or injection system and the ignition system. It is possible to run an   engine management system which just provides one of these subsystems, for   example just the ignition system. It is much more common to use the mapped   ignition within an EMS in isolation than it is to use just the   injection.<br />
<br />
<a name="whatmap" id="whatmap"></a><strong class="style6B">What is a &quot;map&quot;?</strong><br />
Most of us have heard the term &lsquo;mapped ignition&rsquo; and programmed   or mapped injection, but may not understand what this actually is. While the   engine is running, its requirements for fuel and ignition timing will vary   according to certain engine conditions, the main two being engine speed and   engine load. A &lsquo;<strong>map</strong>&rsquo; is no more than a lookup table by engine speed and   load, which gives the appropriate fuel or timing setting for each possible speed   and load condition. There will normally be a map for the injector timings (fuel   map) and a separate map for the ignition timing settings (ignition map) within   the EMS.<br />
<br />
Each map has entries for a predetermined range of engine speeds   (called <strong>speed sites</strong>) and a predetermined range of engine load conditions   (called <strong>load sites</strong>) which generally indicate how far open the throttle   is. The EMS knows the engine speed (derived from the crank sensor or distributor   pickup) and the engine load (from the Throttle Position Sensor or airflow meter)   and will use these two values to &lsquo;look-up&rsquo; the appropriate fuel and timing   settings in each map.<br />
<br />
If the current engine telemetry falls between the   sites in the map then the value is interpolated between the nearest two sites.   Normally there will be speed sites every 500 or so rpm and 8-16 load sites   between closed and open throttle. In the example below speed sites are spaced   every 1000rpm and the 8 load sites are numbered 0 to 7.

            <p align="justify">In this example the engine load increases as   the load site numbers in the left column increase. If the engine were running at   3000rpm - load site 3, then the value looked up would be 26, i.e. 26 degrees of   advance. If the engine were running at 3500rpm - load site 3 then the EMS would   interpolate between the value for 3000rpm (26) and the value for 4000rpm (30)   and calculate a value of 28 degrees.<br />
                <br />
              Note how ignition advance falls as   load increases. This is because cylinder filling is much better when load   increases and therefore the mixture burns faster, requiring less   advance.</p>

              Most EMS fitted to   production vehicles are not programmable, that is to say that the maps within   the EMS which determine the fueling and ignition settings are fixed and cannot   be varied by the owner. This makes good sense from a manufacturer's point of   view since the engine then runs within the permitted parameters, which keeps the   engine emissions and economy within known limits.<br />
  <br />
              There is a burgeoning   market for &lsquo;chip-tuning&rsquo; where the chip containing the maps is replaced by   another which has revised map settings providing better performance from the   engine. The gains to be had here are fairly small except with turbo-charged   engines where the EMS controls the boost. Chip changes on these engines can   yield quite large increases in engine power. Some manufacturers go to great   lengths to stop after-market tuners from decoding the maps within their EMS -   with varying degrees of success. Notable EMS which are difficult if not   impossible to &lsquo;chip&rsquo; are the Rover MEMS and the Ford EECIV systems.<br />
  <br />
              All   after-market EMS are programmable since they have to be fitted to a variety of   different engine installations in a variety of states of tune. If the map values   could not be changed then the EMS would be useless for after-market   applications. Some manufacturers of these systems discourage home mapping and   will only allow authorized dealers to undertake the mapping.<br />
  <br />
              For   clarity's sake we will examine each of the two sub-systems within an EMS   separately. In practice there is a great deal of interaction between the two, as   both systems utilize information from the various engine sensors.<br />

              If we ignore for   a minute the actual EMS, the basic component parts of an injection system are   very straightforward.

              <br />
Fuel tank -</strong>&nbsp;Holds a reservoir of fuel for the engine,   is normally baffled to prevent fuel sloshing around, and the resultant fuel   starvation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fuel filter - </strong> Since an injector pump is a positive   displacement pump any foreign material ingested can stall the pump and kill it   stone dead. This &lsquo;pre-filter&rsquo; prevents rubbish from entering the   pump.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fuel pump</strong> - A high-pressure pump running at around 6 bar   which supplies fuel to the injectors. The fuel pressure regulator regulates to   this pressure between 3 and 4 bar (43 and 58 psi). On some installations the   pump is housed inside the fuel tank with rudimentary filtration, and the fuel   filter then follows in the fuel line. <br />
<strong><br />
Fuel line - </strong>Fuel   pipe that transports the fuel from the pump to the fuel rail.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fuel   rail - </strong>A small fuel gallery from which the injectors take their fuel   supply.<br />
<br />
<strong>Injectors - </strong>Electric valves which when open allow   fuel to be injected into the engine under high pressure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pressure   regulator</strong> - A device that keeps the fuel pressure at a constant rate and   returns any excess fuel to the tank.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fuel return line</strong> - Fuel   pipe which bleeds excess fuel back to the fuel tank.<br />
<br />
<a name="injectionexplain" id="injectionexplain"></a>Most injection systems run at quite high fuel pressure   compared to a system using carburetors. Typically an injection pump will   produce around 6 bar and the system will run at around 3-4 bar (43-58 psi). This   is far in excess of the pressure supplied by a typical fuel pump from a   non-injected system (3-10 psi). The injection system relies on a constant supply   of fuel at a predetermined pressure and generally the pump runs all the time   with excess fuel being returned to the tank. The map for the engine will have   been derived with the fuel supply at this pressure; variations in fuel pressure   will affect the quantity of fuel injected and will seriously affect the running   of the engine, sometimes terminally.<br />
<br />
Carburetors can generally cope with   a short interruption to their fuel supply since they have their own reservoir of   fuel in the float chamber that can be drawn from. Injection systems on the other   hand cannot cope with fuel supply interruptions so it is necessary to ensure   that such interruptions don&rsquo;t take place. It is standard practice to baffle the   fuel tank and use one-way valves to prevent fuel surge. Where space allows, a <strong>surge pot</strong> can be fitted to ensure that fuel surge doesn't&rsquo;t rob the   injection system of fuel at the wrong moment.<br />
<br />
Most fuel <strong>injection   pumps</strong> are gravity fed so they need to be mounted lower than the lowest point   in the fuel tank. An alternative to this is to mount the pump in the fuel tank   itself. Most pumps can be run completely immersed in fuel. In practice they do   this anyway since inside the pump the fuel runs up and around the armature of   the pump. The pump's operation is often controlled by the EMS to prevent the   pump delivering fuel when the engine is not running, for example if the vehicle   is involved in an accident.<br />
<br />
The pump supplies fuel to the   i<strong>njectors</strong> via a <strong>fuel rail</strong> which is a long narrow tube with a   connection for each of the injectors. The fuel supply enters the rail at one   end, while at the other is the <strong>fuel pressure regulator</strong> which ensures that   the fuel pressure remains constant. Since the fuel pressure can affect the   amount of fuel discharged in any given injector time, it is essential that this   pressure is kept constant. Fuel supplied in excess of requirements is bled back   to the fuel tank through the fuel return circuit which is part of the pressure   regulator.<br />
<br />
It is not uncommon for fuel pressure regulators to be tampered   with to supply extra fuel pressure. This is a common dodge when an engine has   been tuned and as a result needs more fuel. Since the map inside the OEM EMS   cannot be varied, a certain increase in fueling can be had by upping the fuel   pressure. Rising-rate fuel pressure regulators achieve the same objective. They   increase fuel pressure when the engine's air demands are high, often increasing   the fuel pressure in response to low vacuum in the inlet manifold, e.g. when the   throttle is increased. Some EMS systems are able to cope with a small increase   in airflow on their own since they know when the engine is running weak due to   the Lambda feedback, and will increase fueling to compensate. This can only be   achieved during steady state running so there will still be glitches in the   fueling here and there.<br />
<br />
The injectors themselves are connected to the <strong>fuel rail</strong> via a clip and &lsquo;O&rsquo; ring which has to contain the high pressure   within the fuel system. An injector is simply an electric valve or solenoid.   Fuel is supplied to the injector at a known and regulated pressure, and the   valve or solenoid is normally closed. Fuel is introduced or injected to the   engine by firing (opening) the injector for a predetermined period of time once   per engine revolution or per engine cycle. The longer the injector is held open   the more fuel is introduced. This injector time is known as the &lsquo;pulse width&rsquo;   and the technique of varying fuel in this manner is known as &lsquo;<strong>pulse width   modulation</strong>&rsquo; as it is the pulse width that is varied according to   requirements. Since the fuel injected is per revolution or cycle, as engine RPM   is increased, so is the number of times the injectors are fired. This has the   effect of meeting the engine's requirements for fuel regardless of   rpm.<br />
<br />
<a name="singlepoint" id="singlepoint"></a><strong class="style6B">Single-point   injection</strong><br />
Single-point injection systems use a single fuel   injector that injects into the inlet manifold or plenum. The fuel injected is   drawn in to the cylinders by airflow in a similar way to a carburetor. Because   of the variations in length and the orientation of the various branches in the   inlet manifold or plenum, the fuel distribution characteristics are not ideal so   economy/emissions and throttle response suffer as a result.<br />

              Although the injector position is shown in the center   of the plenum, this is just for clarity. Usually the injector will be mounted on   or near the throttle body where air velocity is at its highest.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="multipoint" id="multipoint"></a><strong class="style6B">Multi-point injection</strong><br />
              Multi-point   injection systems are much more common and generally have an injector per   cylinder located in each individual manifold runner. This configuration gives   much better control of fueling and better emissions since the fuel can be   metered more closely, and there is less opportunity for the fuel spray to   condense or drop out of the airflow since it is introduced as four small streams   rather than one large one. The closer to the inlet valve the fuel injection   takes place, the better the economy and transient throttle. Most systems use one   injector per cylinder but on certain engines (notably the Rover &lsquo;A&rsquo; series)   there are only two inlet ports since two cylinders share a siamese port. In   this case multi-point would mean two injectors, one per inlet port. This is   still better than a single injector system.<br />
  <br />
              With <strong>multi-point</strong> (or   multi injector) systems there is scope for timing the injection of fuel to   better suit the engine's duty cycle. If the EMS knows the relative position of   each cylinder within the engine's cycle (usually from a cam-phase sensor) then   it can fire the injectors at the optimum time for that cylinder. This is known   as <strong>sequential injection</strong>. Sometimes the EMS will only have knowledge of   the crank position rather than the duty cycle position, and in this case it can   optimize for a pair of cylinders. This is known as <strong>semi-sequential</strong> or <strong>grouped</strong> injection.<br />
  <br />
              Some EMS systems ignore the crank and cycle   position when injecting fuel. They fire all of the injectors at the same time   once per revolution, and this is known as <strong>batched injection. </strong>There is no   penalty to pay power-wise when using batched injection. However, grouped and   sequential injection give a slight edge on economy and transient   throttle/emissions.<br />

              <a name="induction" id="induction"></a><strong class="style6B">Induction   systems</strong><br />
We have examined the physical hardware of the injection   system itself but not actually covered the induction system. With carburetors   they are one and the same thing, but with injection systems they are   separate.<br />
<br />
There are two basic types of induction systems used with   injection - plenum-based systems with a single throttle body,1 and multiple   throttle body systems that do not use a plenum but supply the inlet ports   directly.<br />
<br />
<a name="plenums" id="plenums"></a><strong class="style6B">Plenums</strong><br />
A plenum is a large chamber on the   engine side of the throttle body that helps to even out the pulses in the inlet   tract by providing a buffer of incoming air. This in turn can help economy and   emissions and also provide a longer effective inlet tract which can help   mid-range torque. For single-point injection systems it is a must; for   multi-point it is optional. The plenum is a convenient place to mount airflow   sensors and vacuum sensors since it is at the confluence of all the inlet   runners. When the engine is running, the throttle body determines how much air   will flow into the plenum and therefore the engine. The plenum is generally in a   condition of partial vacuum.<br />
<br />
The EMS can maintain a good and clean idle   by allowing more or less air into the plenum via a bypass valve called the <strong>Idle Air Control Valve</strong>. This together with a special idle routine in the   EMS allows a perfectly controlled idle (and emissions) regardless of ambient   conditions. The <strong>IACV</strong> works independently of the throttle body and   bypasses its operation.<br />
<br />
<a name="throttlebodies" id="throttlebodies"></a><strong class="style6B">Throttle   bodies</strong><br />
A throttle body is no more than a tube or barrel that   regulates air into the engine's inlet manifold, plenum or inlet port. It is   normally of tubular construction with a butterfly or throttle plate that opens   and closes to regulate the airstream. Some throttle bodies have provision for   mounting of fuel injectors, but others do not - it depends entirely on the   application. The type of throttle body that feeds a plenum is normally a single   body and it has no provision for an injector pocket. Throttle bodies are   essentially like carburetors but without the float chamber or jets/venturi's.   Their configuration is often similar to carburetor configurations in that they   are generally available as individual throttle bodies or twinned as dual   bodies.<br />
<br />
<a name="singlebodies" id="singlebodies"></a><strong class="style6B">Individual   throttle bodies</strong><br />
Performance induction systems normally involve   the fitment of individual throttle bodies for each inlet port/manifold runner.   Individual bodies can be aligned precisely with the inlet ports and this can   give advantages. A system that provides individual bodies to each of the inlet   ports should maximize the airflow potential for each cylinder and therefore help   to improve the engine's performance. Sometimes these bodies are designed to bolt   straight to the cylinder head for a particular application and can be designed   to taper to an exact fit on the inlet port.<br />

    <a name="dualbodies" id="dualbodies"></a><strong class="style6B">Dual throttle   bodies</strong><br />
  These perform the same function as the individual bodies   but have two single bodies which are joined together with a fixed spacing   between the individual barrels which may not be absolutely in line with the   inlet ports. These are not unlike Weber DCOE or IDA carburetors in appearance.   Often the difference in alignment between barrels and ports is negligible and so   does not affect the performance of the engine. A set of dual throttle bodies is   normally substantially cheaper than a set of individual throttle bodies. Dual   bodies can often be fitted directly in the place of existing carburetors   utilizing the same manifold, air filters etc., which can bring down the costs   considerably.<br />

  The EMS needs to know a number of things   about the engine's condition in order for the fueling to be metered correctly.   During normal running these boil down to the engine speed and the throttle or   load position. Generally this information is relayed to the EMS by sensors or   triggers on the engine. The engine speed is determined by either a crank   position sensor (which gives crank position from which speed can be derived) or   a trigger of some kind in the distributor (if fitted). Engine load can be   determined using a number of different methods.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="enginepos" id="enginepos"></a><strong class="style6B">Engine speed and   position</strong><br />
  Engine speed and position is normally monitored by one   of the following two methods:<br />
  <br />
  <a name="cranksensor" id="cranksensor"></a><strong class="style6B">Crank   Sensor</strong><br />
  This is now the most common method of determining engine   speed on a modern engine. It is comprised of a disk mounted on or machined into   the flywheel/front pulley that turns with the engine. The disk has a certain   number of teeth around its circumference and a fixed closely mounted induction   sensor that pulses when it encounters a tooth. There is generally a pattern of   missing teeth so that the EMS can tell exactly the crank position as well as   speed. Although the EMS knows the engine's crank position from this sensor, it   does not know the engine's cycle position. In a four-stroke engine the engine   cycle involves two complete revolutions of the engine with the piston at TDC   twice during the cycle. One of these times the cylinder is ready to fire; the   other time is at the end of the exhaust stroke. A crank sensor alone can only   indicate that the piston is at TDC, it cannot know which of the two cycles   positions the engine is at.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="distributorpickup" id="distributorpickup"></a><strong class="style6B">Distributor pickup</strong><br />
  Some older   systems and many after-market systems use a distributor pickup to determine   engine speed. The type of distributor used is normally <strong>Hall effect</strong>, <strong>magnetic reluctor</strong> or <strong>Optronic</strong> and has no in-built advance   mechanism. A distributor-based system has the advantage of mechanical awareness   of the engine's cycle position as well as the crank position. By attaching an   inductive pickup to spark plug lead number '1', the EMS can be made aware of the   engine's cycle position. This can simplify the implementation of the ignition   system for an after-market conversion and provide the feedback necessary for   sequential injection<br />
  <br />
  <a name="engineload" id="engineload"></a><strong class="style6B">Engine   load</strong><br />
  Engine load is normally determined by one of the following   methods:<br />
  <br />
  <a name="tps" id="tps"></a><strong class="style6B">Throttle Position   Sensor</strong><br />
  This is the most common engine load sensor especially on   after market systems. A <strong>TPS</strong> is a small potentiometer (or &lsquo;<strong>throttle   pot</strong>&rsquo;) which is connected directly to the throttle shaft and turns with it.   It returns a value to the EMS depending on the throttle position. TPS sensors   are normally used on performance engines where airflow sensors might become   confused because of pulses in the inlet tract. Because they do not measure   airflow but simply give a throttle position, airflow is assumed to be constant   for any given engine speed and throttle position. If the engine is further   modified, the airflow characteristics may change and the engine may need   re-mapping. EMS systems that use direct airflow measurement can often cope with   changes more effectively and can alter the fueling to suit without a re-mapping   session.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="airflowmeter" id="airflowmeter"></a><strong class="style6B">Air metering   flap</strong><U><br />
  </U> Another way of determining the engine load is to   measure the airflow into the engine and this can be done using a flap which is   deflected by incoming air. This is commonly known as an <strong>airflow meter</strong>.   These are common on older injection systems, but can be confused by reverse   pulses in the inlet tract when more extreme cams are used and can be restrictive   to the inlet airflow.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="mapsensor" id="mapsensor"></a><strong class="style6B">Manifold Air   Pressure sensor</strong><br />
  These measure the vacuum or air pressure in the   inlet manifold which in turn gives an indication of load. They are more commonly   used on turbo charged engines to give an indication of boost level. This is often   referred to as a <strong>MAP </strong>sensor, although not to be confused with a   'map'.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="hotwire" id="hotwire"></a><strong class="style6B">Hot   wire</strong><br />
  This approach uses a heated platinum wire and measures the   current required to keep it at a particular temperature. As air passes over the   wire it cools it down, so the more air that passes, the greater the cooling   effect and therefore the greater the current. The hot wire system can be also be   confused by reverse pulses when more extreme cams are used.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="systemop" id="systemop"></a><strong class="style6B">Operation of the   system</strong><br />
  The way the EMS manages injection is quite simple - the   sensors and triggers on the engine relay information to the EMS about engine   speed and load. The EMS uses these to extract the appropriate injector time from   the injection map and then fires the injector(s) for this length of time. If the   system uses <strong>batched injection</strong> then all of the injectors are fired at the   same time once per engine revolution. With <strong>grouped injection</strong> the   injectors are grouped together in pairs which are fired at an optimal point in   the engine's cycle which best suits those two cylinders, again once per   revolution. Where the engine sensors are able to determine the engine's cycle   position (usually from a cam phase sensor) it is possible to fire the injectors   at the optimum time for each individual cylinder. This is known as <strong>sequential   injection. </strong>Rather than firing once per revolution, each injector is fired   for twice the pulse width at the optimum time in the engine's cycle, e.g.   immediately before the inlet valve opens. There are minor benefits in economy   and emissions to be had from using sequential or grouped injection, but   power-wise there is little or no difference.<br />
  <br />
  As we can see, information   from these two main input sources allows the EMS to orchestrate the engine's   fueling so that the engine runs happily in normal conditions. There are times   however when the engine is not running under these ideal conditions and it is at   these times that other vital feedback is required to allow the EMS to run the   engine properly. Generally under these conditions the EMS makes adjustments or <strong>corrections</strong> to the fuel map according to what it knows about the   prevailing conditions. The main environmental conditions that are monitored by   the EMS are as follows:<br />
  <br />
  <a name="enginetemp" id="enginetemp"></a><strong class="style6B">Engine   temperature</strong><U><br />
  </U> When an engine starts from cold it is well   below its normal operating temperature. This causes some of the fuel injected   into the engine to condense rather than atomizing and being drawn in   efficiently. Combustion chamber temperatures are also low which leads to   incomplete and slow combustion. These effects cause the engine to run weak and   require extra fuel to be supplied to compensate. In a conventional system the   '<strong>choke</strong>' on the carburetor performs this function. On an injection system   a <strong>coolant temperature sensor</strong> provides the EMS with the engine's   temperature and enables it to &lsquo;correct&rsquo; the fueling. This correction involves   adding a percentage of extra fuel according to a predetermined correction   profile by temperature, up to the normal operating temperature of the engine.   The amount of extra fuel will vary from engine to engine and according to the   engine's temperature and rpm, since the effects of condensing are less when air   speeds are higher.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="airtemp" id="airtemp"></a><strong class="style6B">Air   temperature</strong><br />
  When air temperatures are high, the density of the   air being inducted falls off, thereby lessening the volume of oxygen available   for combustion. If the fuel that is injected remains constant then the mixture   will become too rich. To compensate for this the EMS applies a correction to the   base map according to a predetermined correction profile. As the air temperature   rises so air density will continue to fall and hence the fueling will be   reduced. Information about air temperature is relayed to the EMS by an <strong>air   temperature sensor</strong>. To some extent airflow meters can compensate for lower   density air since depending on their type they may show less volume of air   inducted, and this will cause the EMS to adjust the fueling   accordingly.</p>
<p align="justify"><a name="batteryvoltage" id="batteryvoltage"></a><strong class="style6B">Battery   voltage</strong><br />
  If the voltage of the vehicle's battery varies then it is   likely that the time taken to open the injectors will vary. Since the EMS times   the overall injector pulse, if the injector takes longer to open then the time   it remains open will be that much shorter and therefore the fuel introduced to   the engine will be correspondingly less. Some EMS have a correction of injector   times applied to the base map for variations in voltage; the corrections are   usually small but during shorter injector times (idle and cruise) they can be   very significant to the efficient running of the engine.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="mixture" id="mixture"></a><strong class="style6B">Mixture   strength</strong><br />
  Some EMS make use of a <strong>Lambda sensor</strong> which sits   in the exhaust of an engine and measures the <strong>air/fuel ratio</strong> or strength   of the mixture while the engine is running. During conditions of steady state   running, the EMS is able to tell from this sensor whether the mixture is rich or   lean, and can make real-time adjustments to bring the mixture back to   'chemically correct'. This generally happens only when in steady state, e.g. at   idle or when cruising, and is known as &lsquo;<strong>closed loop running</strong>&rsquo;. Over a   period of time the EMS can &lsquo;learn&rsquo; whether the mixture is rich or lean and make   long term adjustments.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="knock" id="knock"></a><strong class="style6B">Knock   sensing</strong><br />
  A <strong>knock sensor</strong> is an acoustic sensor that listens   for pre-ignition - more commonly known as knocking or pinking/pinging. It is   most likely eradicated by adjusting the timing but there are circumstances where   the mixture needs trimming as well. When this is detected the EMS is able to   adjust the fueling if required in order to help eradicate the   problem.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="othercorrections" id="othercorrections"></a><strong class="style6B">Other   Corrections</strong><br />
  There are some additional corrections that the EMS   can apply intuitively by examining changes in state or other derived conditions.   The most common are:<br />
  <br />
  <a name="accelclamp" id="accelclamp"></a><strong class="style6B">Acceleration   fueling</strong> <br />
  When the throttle is opened suddenly there is   generally a weakening affect on the induction since air is lighter than fuel and   is drawn in more rapidly. Weakening on throttle opening transients is also   caused by the fact that the fuel has already been injected and the inlet valve   is open before changes in the inlet manifold can take place due to a throttle   change. This is only a transitory effect but it can cause the engine to stumble   or stutter on initial acceleration. To counteract this tendency the EMS can keep   track of sudden changes in throttle position or load and add a percentage of   extra fuel when this happens. The extra fuel is only added for a short period   and is then decayed over another short period. This is normally a number of   engine revolutions rather than a period of time. This is known as   &lsquo;<strong>accelerator clamp</strong>&rsquo;.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="decelclamp" id="decelclamp"></a><strong class="style6B">Deceleration   fueling</strong><br />
  When the throttle is closed suddenly and the engine is   being overdriven, the hydrocarbon levels in the exhaust can rise dramatically.   It is also possible for un-burnt fuel to ignite in the exhaust system producing   the characteristic popping on overrun. To overcome this some EMS will either   reduce the fuel to the engine on overrun or in some cases cut it off all   together.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="cranking" id="cranking"></a><strong class="style6B">Cranking   fueling</strong><br />
  When the engine is actually being started, the cranking   speed is quite low (150-200rpm or thereabouts). This means that the airspeed in   the inlet ports is minimal and may not be sufficient to atomize and draw in all   the fuel from the injectors. It is normally necessary to add some extra fuel   while cranking to overcome this drawback. The amount of extra fuel to be added   can be built into the base map at speed site zero, but it is more usual to have   a correction to the base map which is a percentage of extra fuel to be added   when cranking. This extra fueling can also vary with engine temperature so the   correction is normally in a table for each of a range of engine temperatures.   This correction normally decays quite quickly once the engine has fired since it   is only required at low crank speeds. The percentage of extra fuel required will   vary from engine to engine. This is often known as <strong>startup correction</strong> or <strong>cranking correction</strong>. <br />
  <br />
  <a name="additional" id="additional"></a><strong class="style6B">Additional   information</strong><br />
  There is some additional information about injection   systems which does not fit neatly into any particular category but is   nonetheless useful information. This is detailed below:<br />
  <br />
  <a name="injectorpos" id="injectorpos"></a><strong class="style6B">Injector position</strong><br />
  The position of the   injector in the inlet tract has a noticeable affect on the way the engine runs.   It can affect economy, transient throttle and power output. It is generally   accepted that injector positioning close to the inlet port gives good economy,   transient throttle and idle, together with good emissions, and that injector   positions further back in the inlet tract improve power at the expense of these   criteria. Ultimately for the best power output the injector should be sited as   far back as possible, i.e. in the trumpet or air-horn. Sitting the injectors here   does give a big problem at low throttle openings and low rpm since the fuel hits   the butterfly. It can also cause fuel to be bounced out of the trumpet by the   shock waves in the inlet.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="dualinject" id="dualinject"></a><strong class="style6B">Dual injector   systems</strong><br />
  Dual injector systems attempt to exploit the benefits of   the close-to-port injector while also gaining from the power increase to be had   from having the injector in the trumpet. The way this is done is to fit two   injectors, one close to the inlet port and one in the trumpet. The EMS controls   these two injectors using the near injector for part throttle, low rpm and   transient and switching to the second trumpet mounted injector when the engine   is at <strong>WOT</strong> (Wide Open Throttle). Some systems switch from one injector to   the other immediately a certain set of conditions is reached, while other system   go 50/50 between the injectors or grade one injector's usage down while ramping   the other's up. This system if implemented properly gives the best of both   worlds.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="twininject" id="twininject"></a><strong class="style6B">Twin injector   systems</strong><br />
  Twin injector systems are normally used when the size of   injector required would be very large and might affect the metering and   atomization capabilities at low rpm and idle, typically on a turbo charged engine   where fueling requirements vary enormously from transient to wide open   throttle. The fuel can be metered through one injector when requirements are   low, and through both when requirements grow exponentially, or it can be metered   through both at all times. Often a second set of injectors are fitted by   after-market tuners whose modifications may require fueling beyond the capacity   of the current injectors. This is most likely to happen in turbo or supercharged   installations.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="dutycycle" id="dutycycle"></a><strong class="style6B">Injector duty   cycle</strong><br />
  In order to inject a fuel into the engine, the injector is   opened for a period of time, known as the <strong>pulse width</strong>, this time is   always the same for a given quantity of fuel, regardless of engine speed. As   engine rpm increases, the time available per revolution to fire the injector is   less - at 6000rpm the time available is exactly half the time at available at   3000rpm. As this injection opportunity gets progressively smaller the injectors   are required to fire much more frequently. This can result in the injector being   open almost all the time. When the injection system used is sequential, the   requirement is to be able to deliver the fuel at a time when the inlet valve is   closed. This further reduces the injectors' opportunity to fire. <br />
  <br />
  The   percentage of time that the injector is open is known as the &lsquo;<strong>duty cycle</strong>&rsquo;   and this represents the relationship between the time the injector is closed,   measured against the time it is open. If the duty cycle goes above 90per cent   anywhere in the rev band (i.e. the injector is open for more 90per cent of the   time) then the injector capacity is being reached and the engine may require   larger injectors. These will discharge more fuel in a given period of time which   means the injector times can be decreased, bringing the duty cycle into   acceptable limits. Unfortunately this also means that the engine will need   re-mapping to suit the new larger injectors or the mixture will be hopelessly   rich. <br />
  <br />
  <a name="scaling" id="scaling"></a>Some EMS have a scaling factor which   represents the relationship between the map figure units and the pulse width. By   varying this, the whole map can be scaled up or down for different sized   injectors. This is not a perfect way of coping with a change of injector size   because the time taken to open the injector is the same and the scale factor   affects this too. However it will get 95per cent of the way there when changing   injector sizes. <br />
  <br />
  <a name="sizing" id="sizing"></a><strong class="style6B">Injector   sizing</strong><br />
  In order to size injectors for a given engine it is   important to know their discharge rate. From this and an approximation of the   engine's potential rpm, potential peak power and torque an estimate can be made   and an appropriately sized injector chosen. It is better to err on the large   side just in case you reach the injector capacity while mapping and have to   start from scratch. Larger injectors have a couple of disadvantages in that the   granularity of adjustment is larger and the atomization of fuel is poorer with a   larger orifice.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="cleverstuff" id="cleverstuff"></a><strong class="style6B">The clever   stuff</strong><br />
  As well as the normal running of the engine and   administering of fuel according to the map settings some EMS can perform some   rather clever tricks which can help with smooth running, performance, economy   and emissions. Most of these involve a feedback loop of some kind from the   various engine sensors and involve assumptions about the way in which the engine   is being used.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="idlecontrol" id="idlecontrol"></a><strong class="style6B">Idle   control</strong><br />
  When an engine is idling and at normal temperature, its   airflow requirements are fairly constant and the ignition advance and the idle   can be set at a constant rate. If any of the environmental conditions vary, e.g.   engine temperature, air density etc. then the required airflow, ignition advance   and fueling may need to vary in order to allow the engine to idle. In a   carburetor-based system there is often a fast idle that is set when the engine   is cold and the choke is operating, which raises the idle speed to prevent   stalling. Most EMS systems use an idle control system for when the engine is   idling. An idle air control valve (<strong>IACV</strong>) allows the air to the engine to   be metered independently of the throttle butterfly. If the rpm falls below   acceptable limits then more air is bled into the engine. If the rpm goes beyond   an upper limit then less air is bled in. Together with fueling and ignition   variation, this system maintains a rock steady idle with acceptable emissions in   all conditions whether the engine is hot or cold.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="closedloop" id="closedloop"></a><strong class="style6B">Closed loop running</strong><br />
  In order to   minimize emissions and also to ensure that the exhaust catalyst function is   optimized, many EMS have special routines coded within them to exploit   situations where the engine is not under full load conditions, i.e. when   cruising on a partial throttle. A large proportion of motorway driving is done   under these conditions especially when cruise control is fitted to the car. The   EMS enters a state know as &lsquo;<strong>closed-loop running</strong>&rsquo; when the throttle   position and engine speed are more or less constant. This indicates a cruising   condition. In this state the feedback from the Lambda sensor and knock sensor   are used to trim the fueling and advance to give the best possible economy and   efficiency. When running in the closed loop the EMS will progressively lean off   the mixture until the feedback from the sensors indicate that it is approaching   detonation and will hold the mixture just before this point until the engine   telemetry tells it that the engine is no longer cruising. This is known as   &lsquo;<strong>lean cruise</strong>&rsquo; and is only possible if the EMS has <strong>Lambda </strong>and <strong>knock sensing</strong>. On non-catalyst cars, lean cruise can go even further with   the leaning of the mixture to save more fuel. However the mixture has to be kept   near<strong> stichomythic </strong>for the catalyst to work effectively.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="openloop" id="openloop"></a><strong class="style6B">Open loop</strong><br />
  This is not really a clever   mode of operation but included here for completeness. At full throttle, the   Lambda (oxygen) sensor is almost always ignored. This is called <strong>open loop   running</strong>. In this situation, the EMS bases its decisions entirely on the   information contained within the maps. This characteristic means that   self-learning cannot be used (or relied upon) to cater for the increased   full-throttle fuel supply required for engine mods that increase power and   therefore airflow. However, self-learning often does help in the changed   requirements occurring in part-throttle conditions.<br />
  <br />
  The reason the <strong>Lambda sensor</strong> is normally ignored is that it can only indicate mixture   strength through quite a narrow band of air/fuels ratios and it is likely that   its feedback will be swamped by the fueling when accelerating and at wide open   throttle. Some systems fit a wide-band Lambda sensor which can report on the   mixture strength over a wider band of settings and can therefore give useful   feedback even when the engine is at wide open throttle and in the acceleration   fueling band of operation. This can allow the EMS to learn about mixture   strength and monitor/adjust the fueling even in these extreme   circumstances.<br />
  <br />
  Most EMS also use map information only for ignition timing   in this situation. However, a few EMS use the feedback from the <strong>knock   sensor</strong> in a self-learning approach similar to that done with the lambda   sensor on the injection system.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="selflearn" id="selflearn"></a><strong class="style6B">Self   learning</strong><U><br />
  </U> In addition to <strong>closed loop</strong> running the   lambda sensor is also used in some EMS as part of a self-learning system. For   example if the fuel pressure regulator in your car is working incorrectly and   supplying less pressure than it should, the mixture will probably be a bit lean.   The Lambda sensor feeds this back to the EMS which then richens up the fueling.   If this is happening consistently then the EMS knows that the mixtures are   always a bit lean and will permanently richen up the mixture. It has learned   that the mixture is lean and that richer mixtures are needed, and will always   run this correction. If the pressure regulator is subsequently replaced or   repaired, the EMS will then gradually re-learn the new requirements. This   self-learning process occurs in most manufacturers EMS but is rarer in   after-market systems. Self-learning of mixture strength is totally dependent on   the Lambda sensor.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="injectorcut" id="injectorcut"></a><strong class="style6B">Injector   cutting</strong><br />
  In the interest of economy and low emissions some EMS can   switch off the injectors completely when the engine is being overdriven, for   example when you lift off the throttle totally. The injectors resume normal   service when engine revs drop to around 500rpm above idle. If you watch the   tachometer closely you can see the needle lift a bit when the injectors resume   their flow. This is more usual on manufacturers EMS than after-market   ones.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="selfdiagnose" id="selfdiagnose"></a><strong class="style6B">Self Diagnosis</strong><br />
  Many   engine management systems also have a 'self-diagnosis' ability. This allows you   to probe the EMS using a PC and it will tell you if it has developed a problem.   For example if the engine temperature sensor wire is broken the EMS will report   that there is no input from it. Some EMS will communicate faults via fault codes   or flashing lights, while others require a diagnostic computer to be attached.   Again, this is more common with OE management systems.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="traction" id="traction"></a><strong class="style6B">Traction-control, cruise control and   drive-by-wire</strong><br />
  There are areas of an EMS that can interact with   other systems on the vehicle such as traction-control and cruise-control. In the   more sophisticated systems a separate traction-control unit can communicate with   the EMS to invoke a variable rev limit that cuts engine torque if it senses that   traction is being lost. Normally this is done by using a soft-cut rev limiter   which is invoked at will. On other systems the EMS is actually able to back off   the throttle.<br />
  <br />
  Some recent EMS that are installed alongside intelligent or   adaptive transmissions are designed to co-operate with the transmission. A   common practice is &lsquo;drive-by-wire&rsquo; where there is no direct connection between   the accelerator and the throttle butterfly. Instead, a stepper motor controlled   by the EMS applies the throttle. This makes it easy for the cruise-control or   adaptive transmission to orchestrate the engine as it sees fit. A   traction-control system might back off the throttle in response to lost   traction. A cruise-control system will both apply and back-off the throttle to   maintain its programmed speed.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="revlimiter" id="revlimiter"></a><strong class="style6B">Rev   limiting</strong><br />
  Most EMS systems implement a <strong>rev limiter</strong>, some   allow a <strong>soft-cut</strong> where the engine selectively misfires followed by a <strong>hard-cut </strong>a little higher up where the engine simply stonewalls. Some   limiters cut off all fuel at the prescribed engine speed, withholding it until   you're 500rpm below the limit. Other rev limiters cut off the spark (or   injectors) of individual cylinders one after the other, progressively cutting   more and more until the <strong>hard-cut</strong> limit is reached so that you can barely   feel that you have reached the maximum allowable rpm. These soft limiters mean   that the car can be used right to the rev limit without a worry. Normally the   EMS will maintain the tach signal consistently to ensure that it doesn't&rsquo;t go   crazy. Often the rev limiting is coupled with a shift light that warns the   driver that the rev limiter is about to operate and he should change up a gear.   With batched and grouped injection systems, selective cutting of fuel can be   dangerous since the fuel is not injected at the optimum time for each cylinder   and it is quite possible for a cylinder to induct only a partial charge of fuel   which could result in detonation and resulting damage.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="tacho" id="tacho"></a><strong class="style6B">Tach and tell-tale</strong><br />
  Most EMS systems drive   the tachometer (rev counter) directly which allows them to maintain the tach   reading even when the rev limiter is invoked. Some after market EMS also provide   a tell-tale facility that will flick the tach needle to the highest rpm   attained during its previous use.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="fancontrol" id="fancontrol"></a><strong class="style6B">Fan   control</strong><br />
  EMS systems as fitted to production cars can also control   other aspects of the engine's systems. It is very common for the EMS to control   the cooling fan, switching it on and off as required.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="waterinject" id="waterinject"></a><strong class="style6B">Water injection</strong><br />
  Some EMS systems can   control a secondary water injection system that is used in forced induction   engines to cool the incoming charge and to prevent detonation. They may also be   capable of controlling water-cooling sprays onto charge coolers that help to   cool the air inducted into the engine.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="nitrous" id="nitrous"></a><strong class="style6B">Nitrous   oxide injection</strong><U><br />
  </U> Nitrous Oxide (NO2) is a gas that contains   much more oxygen than air does on a weight by weight basis; NO2 is often used to   boost the power of an engine. It is injected with extra fuel and effectively   increases the amount of fuel and oxygen inducted into the engine with similar   affects to turbo charging or supercharging. Some EMS systems have provision for   controlling the nitrous injection and the extra fuel requirements.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="antilag" id="antilag"></a><strong class="style6B">Turbo Anti-lag</strong><U><br />
  </U> One of the problems   associated with turbo charged engines is the time taken for the turbocharger to   spin up to speed and provide boost. When the engine is accelerating the   turbocharger is spinning rapidly and making boost, but when the gear change   takes place or when the throttle is lifted, the turbo will slow down and boost   will drop off. The boost takes some time to get going again which means that the   engine will drop off the power band. This time between planting the accelerator   and boost becoming available is called &lsquo;<strong>turbo-lag</strong>&rsquo; because the turbo lags   behind the accelerator. Some EMS systems are able to minimize this when the   engine is backing off by firing the mixture in the cylinder when the exhaust   valve is open. The burning gases expand rapidly and exit the exhaust valve at   high speed instead of trying to push the piston down. The &lsquo;kick&rsquo; from the   exhaust keeps the turbo speed up and minimizes lag. Generally this is only done   when the engine is being backed off, so although the cylinder doesn't fire   properly, the net effect on the vehicle's performance is marginal. However the   effect on the turbo spin speed is quite marked. Firing the cylinder when the   exhaust valve is open also provides those spectacular backfiring, banging and   exhaust-flaming antics seen so frequently in the WRC turbo cars.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="auxilliary" id="auxilliary"></a><strong class="style6B">Auxiliary device outputs and   control</strong><br />
  Since the EMS knows so much about engine conditions, it   is often useful to be able to harness the information to drive or run other   systems associated with the engine. Many EMS do provide outputs or feeds which   enable the more enterprising to use the EMS information to make improvements to   other aspects of the car. For example EMS information can be used to switch an   alternator off at high rpm and thereby minimize the parasitic losses associated   when the power is needed most, or to modulate the cooling fan at times when the   engine's power is needed.<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <strong class="style6B">Feature   disclaimer</strong><br />
  There are many other features and options within   after-market EMS which may or may not be used with a particular installation.   Some are obscure and are designed to meet the particular requirements of a   certain piece of injection hardware or another co-operating device. It would be   madness to attempt to list all of this rich cornucopia of functionality for the   many and varied EMS available. Suffice it to say that the features listed above   cope with 99.99 percent of what is required from a management system and in the   interests of keeping it simple I will elaborate no further.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="ignition" id="ignition"></a><strong class="style6B">Ignition management</strong><br />
  There are two types   of ignition management system, those triggered by a distributor and those   triggered from a crank position sensor, often called <strong>distributor-less.</strong> The   adoption of the term distributor-less can be misleading since many   crank-triggered systems still use a distributor cap and rotor arm to dispatch   the spark to the appropriate cylinder. With these systems a crank sensor and not   the distributor does the triggering to the EMS.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="distributor" id="distributor"></a><strong class="style6B">Distributor based systems </strong><br />
  Distributor-based systems use a conventional distributor to trigger   the EMS but the distributor will have no in-built advance mechanism. Typically   the trigger will come well before the ignition point and the EMS will work out   when to fire the ignition coil. The spark is then carried to the appropriate   cylinder in the conventional way via the rotor arm and HT leads.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="cranktrigger" id="cranktrigger"></a><strong class="style6B">Crank trigger based</strong><U><br />
  </U> Since   crank-triggered systems only know the engine position and not the cycle position   they need a way of ensuring that the correct cylinder receives the spark. There   are three common ways of achieving this.<br />
  <br />
  The first is to use a   conventional distributor cap and rotor arm that is normally attached to the end   of one of the camshafts and routes the spark to the appropriate   cylinder.<br />
  <br />
  The second method is to use two coils that are paired to fire   cylinders 1 &amp; 4 and 2 &amp; 3 respectively. When one of the coils fires it   sends the spark to both of its cylinders. One of these will be on the firing   stroke and will fire normally, the other will be on the scavenge part of the   cycle (exhaust stroke) where the spark will be wasted, for this reason these   systems are known generically as &lsquo;<strong>wasted spark&rsquo;</strong>.<br />
  <br />
  The third method   is to use an additional sensor on one of the camshafts so that the EMS is aware   of the engine's cycle position and can fire the appropriate cylinder at the   correct time using individual coils for each cylinder.</p>
<p align="justify"><a name="dischema" id="dischema"></a><strong class="style6B">Distributor   triggered</strong><br />
  This type of arrangement is used with early EMS   such as the Ford ESC system. It is also popular for after-market applications   since it enables the installer maximum re-use of existing components. Any   inaccuracies in the distributor manufacture are reflected in the distribution of   timing between the cylinders, since the spark is always relative to the trigger   points given by the distributor. Typically the distributor will trigger four   times per engine cycle i.e. twice per engine revolution.<br />
  <br />
  The distributor   will have no advance mechanism installed or will have the advance mechanism   rendered inoperative since the EMS provides for the engine's   needs.</p>
<table width="80" border="0" align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="3" bgcolor="#000000">
  <tr>

  </tr>
</table>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><a name="disworks" id="disworks"></a><strong class="style6B">How it   works</strong><br />
Normally the distributor will &lsquo;trigger&rsquo; at around 65-70   degrees before TDC since this is greater than the expected maximum advance. The   EMS will then look up the ignition map to calculate the appropriate timing   figure for the engine's speed and load, then using the engine's speed as a   factor will calculate how long to wait before firing the spark. The initial   trigger point must be at least the maximum advance figure plus a few degrees   latency to allow the microprocessor to do its work.<br />
<br />
The conventional   distributor cap and rotor arm ensure that the spark goes to the correct cylinder   since the EMS will produce a spark every time the distributor pulses. Given that   the system is given a pulse from the distributor for each of the appropriate   cylinders, it would not be difficult to use the triggering information for the   injection system to provide sequential injection. However it would be necessary   to have additional feedback to determine which of the pulses belonged to   cylinder number '1'. I have seen this done by attaching an inductive pickup onto   number '1' spark plug lead.<br />
<br />
<a name="crankschema" id="crankschema"></a><strong class="style6B">Crank   triggered</strong><br />
This type of system is a halfway house toward a   totally distributor-less system. Only the distributor cap and rotor arm are   retained; the rest of the distributor is not present. Typically the rotor arm is   installed on the end of the camshaft and the distributor cap is bolted over. It   has most of the advantages of a totally distributor-less system in that it uses a   crank sensor. The EMS however is unaware of the engine's cycle position so it   can only provide batched or grouped injection.<br />
<br />
The Rover &lsquo;K&rsquo; series MEMS   uses this system for its basic implementation and therefore can only provide   grouped injection. Some of the Vauxhall engines use this system also. It is a   very popular and low-cost way of implementing managed ignition. It allows the   manufacturer to re-use many of the constituent parts of earlier   distributor-based systems.</p>

              The EMS is aware of the TDC position from the crank sensor   and by counting teeth can tell exactly what the engine position is at any time.   It uses this information together with the information from the throttle   position sensor/MAP sensor to look up the appropriate ignition timing settings   from the ignition map. It is then able to determine exactly when to fire the   coil. The coil is fired twice per engine revolution at exactly opposite   positions in the engine's rotation because when cylinder 1 &amp; 4 are at TDC,   cylinders 2 &amp; 3 are at BDC and vice versa. The spark is then routed to the   appropriate cylinder by the rotor arm and cap.<br />

              This type of system does away with the distributor   altogether. It uses the crank sensor to indicate where TDC is and then uses the   signals from the sensor and the map information to determine when to fire the   spark (twice per revolution). It groups the signals to two separate coils which   provide the spark to pairs of cylinders that are at the same relative crank   position. One of these cylinders will be on the firing stroke and will ignite;   the other will be in the scavenge stroke and therefore the spark will be   &lsquo;wasted&rsquo;. This is why these systems are known generically as &lsquo;<strong>wasted   spark</strong>&rsquo; systems. In practice the coils are usually double-ended with a   high-tension lead running from either end to each of the cylinders in the   pairing.<br />
              <br />
The Ford Zetec and Vauxhall 16V engines use this type of   system.<br />
<br />
There are variations to the wasted spark system which uses   individual coils for each cylinder that are paired together in parallel rather   than using a pair of coils, each serving two cylinders.<br />

The EMS is aware of the   TDC position from the crank sensor and by counting teeth can tell exactly where   the engine position is at any time. It uses this information together with the   information from the throttle position sensor/MAP sensor to look up the   appropriate ignition timing settings from the ignition map. It is then able to   determine exactly when to fire the coils. Each coil is fired once per engine   revolution at exactly opposite positions in the engine's rotation, because when   cylinder 1 &amp; 4 are at TDC, cylinders 2 &amp; 3 are at BDC and vice versa.   The spark travels to both of the paired cylinders.<br />
<br />
<a name="camsensor" id="camsensor"></a><span class="style6B">Cam Sensor</span> <br />
This type of system is similar to the   &lsquo;<strong>wasted spark</strong>&rsquo; system in that it is distributor-less and multiple coil. It   has a cam phase sensor in addition to the crank sensor which allows the EMS to   determine where in the engine's cycle each individual cylinder is. There is a   discrete coil per cylinder and the EMS is then able to fire the appropriate   coil.<br />
<br />
The cam phase sensor can also be used by the injection system to   provide proper sequential injection. The Rover MEMS as fitted to the VVC engine   uses this kind of system, but just uses two coils as per the wasted spark   set-up. The cam phase sensor is also used by the EMS to help drive the VVC   mechanism. The EMS on the Subaru Imprezza uses this type of   system.</p>

It uses this information   together with the information from the throttle position sensor/MAP sensor to   look up the appropriate ignition timing settings from the ignition map. Using   the crank and cam position sensors it is then able to determine exactly when to   fire each individual coil since it knows which cylinder is at the firing   position of the cycle. Each cylinder' s individual coil is fired once per engine   cycle at exactly the appropriate time. The spark is routed directly to the   appropriate cylinder.<br />

  <a name="timingadjust" id="timingadjust"></a><strong class="style6B">Timing   adjustments</strong><br />
              In the normal course of events, with the engine   operating at the correct temperature in defined conditions, the EMS will use   load and engine speed to derive the correct ignition timing from the map.   However there are circumstances under which the EMS may need to vary the   ignition timing. These normally boil down to four circumstances, engine/coolant   temperature, air temperature, knocking and start-up.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="enginetemp_ign" id="enginetemp_ign"></a><strong class="style6B">Engine temperature</strong><br />
              When the engine   temperature is low the burn times within the cylinders are longer than with a   fully warmed-up engine and the ignition timing will normally need to be advanced   a little to adjust. The EMS usually has a small map of ignition timing   adjustments graded by engine temperature that are added to the base timing   figures. The engine temperature information is relayed to the EMS by an engine   temperature sensor attached to the engine.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="airtemp_ign" id="airtemp_ign"></a><strong class="style6B">Air temperature</strong><br />
              When air temperature   varies, so does burn time of the inducted mixture since it is less dense. Again,   a small map of ignition adjustments graded by air temperature is added to the   base timing figures. The engine temperature information is relayed to the EMS by   an air temperature sensor located near to the air inlet.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="knock_ign" id="knock_ign"></a><strong class="style6B">Knock sensing</strong><br />
              There may be times during   the operation of the engine, even after adjustments have been applied, when the   timing calculated does not meet the engine's requirements. Sometimes this may   result in &lsquo;pinking&rsquo; (a.k.a. &lsquo;knocking&rsquo; or &lsquo;pinging&rsquo;) where the mixture burns so   fast that it meets the piston just before TDC, while it is still on the   compression stroke - rather than meeting the piston just after TDC on the power   stroke. This is very harmful to the engine. Some EMS have an acoustic sensor   called a &lsquo;<strong>knock sensor</strong>&rsquo; which listens for knocking and will inform the   EMS when this occurs. The EMS is then able to make adjustments to the timing to   prevent the occurrence of knocking.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="cranking_ign" id="cranking_ign"></a><strong class="style6B">Start-up or cranking</strong><br />
              When starting an   engine, its effective rpm is quite low - around 200rpm or so. If the ignition   timing used at idle is set to around 25 degrees (which is about average for a   mapped engine) the chances are that the piston will hit the ignited mixture   while still on the compression stroke. This will have the effect of pushing the   piston down against its normal rotation, effectively this is &lsquo;knocking&rsquo; at   cranking speeds. This is known as &lsquo;<strong>kicking back</strong>&rsquo; and is normally   characterized by the starter motor &lsquo;straining&rsquo; and slowing right down, this   makes the engine difficult to start and can easily destroy a starter motor in   short order.<br />
  <br />
              This is a common problem on engines equipped with mechanical   ignition systems and more extreme cams, since the engine needs plenty of   ignition advance at idle to run properly. Unfortunately this extra advance can   also cause &lsquo;kick back&rsquo; and there is no way with a mechanical system to   differentiate the timing between cranking and idle.<br />
  <br />
              EMS solve this   problem by having a separate timing value for cranking/start-up which is   normally set to around 5-8 degrees. This is low enough to prevent kick-back but   is high enough to start the engine. The moment the engine fires, the appropriate   ignition setting from the base map is used.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="2dvs3d" id="2dvs3d"></a><strong class="style6B">2D and non-mapped systems Vs 3D mapped   systems</strong><br />
              After-market mapped ignition systems are now quite   common, and you may wonder what advantages they offer over a conventional   ignition system. A conventional ignition system is a 2D system that only takes   into account engine speed and not load on the engine. It gives a constant timing   that is dependent on engine rpm only. At full throttle this is acceptable,   however on part throttle, economy and driveability are seriously affected. In   another vein with some performance engines, the required advance may not alter   in a linear manner. There may be places in the engine's speed range where   required advance can fall even though rpm is rising.<br />
  <br />
              Some 2D systems go   part of the way towards varying the ignition timing for load by fitting a vacuum   advance device which advances the ignition when vacuum in the inlet manifold is   high, e.g. when load on the engine is low, but this will be crude at best. A   mapped system can give precisely the right ignition advance whatever the engine   speed or load. This improves the tractability of the engine dramatically as well   as giving far better economy.<br />
  <br />
              To appreciate the difference between a 2D   and a 3D mapped ignition system you have to understand a little about combustion   within your engine. When a fuel and air mixture ignites within the combustion   chamber, the burning of the charge starts at the sparking plug and spreads   throughout the mixture from that point. It takes a given amount of time for the   whole charge in the chamber to burn, expand, and hence force the piston down the   bore. This is why we have to start the ignition process before the piston   reaches top-dead-center. This lead-time is called &quot;<strong>ignition   advance</strong>&quot;.<br />
  <br />
              It follows that as engine revs rise and the engine turns   faster there is less time for the charge in the chamber to burn hence the need   to increase the ignition advance with increasing engine speed. Before the age of   sophisticated electronics the ignition advance was always controlled   mechanically - in the very early days by a lever mounted on the steering wheel   or handlebars of the machine. The driver, or rider, altered the advance   according to his best guess, going on the feel of the engine - not always too   successfully!<br />
  <br />
              What followed was a mechanical advance system based on a   centrifugal system of weights located in the distributor. As engine speed   increased, the centrifugal force acting on the weights increased and caused them   to move outwards against the resistance of a couple of clockwork springs, and in   doing so advancing the ignition. The springs pulled the weights back as the   engine slowed again reducing the advance. A series of stops and different   tension springs allowed the ignition advance progress to be controlled, or   altered from one engine to another, dependent on engine speed.<br />
  <br />
              But there   is another factor affecting advance that needs to be taken into account - <strong>cylinder filling</strong>. The speed at which the mixture in the combustion   chamber burns varies with the amount of compression that the charge is under.   This in turn depends on how full the cylinder is before compression takes place.   For example: on a small throttle opening at higher rpm, the cylinder will only   partially fill, compared to wide-open throttle at the same engine speed. It   follows that you need different ignition timings for the same engine speed, but   dependent on throttle position or engine load.<br />
  <br />
              With the centrifugal   distributor advance systems, manufacturers often fit a <strong>vacuum advance   unit</strong>. This pulls the timing to more advance when there is a high vacuum   present in the inlet manifold (throttle closed or nearly so). The problem with   these mechanical systems is that they are crude in operation and movement of the   distributor base plate at high rpm causes timing scatter. For this reason most   performance engines have the vacuum advance removed and the base plates welded   up.<br />
  <br />
              An EMS can control the ignition with very few moving parts; all it   needs is a trigger and a load sensor of some kind. The EMS knows the load on the   engine as well as the engine rpm. Since the ignition timing is mapped for each   engine speed and load, the timing is at the optimum for the engine for each load   condition including part throttle. This gives the best possible performance and   economy whatever the throttle position. In addition since the triggering systems   invariably have no physical wear points the timing stays set correctly more or   less indefinitely and is maintenance free. There are other spin-offs such as rev   limiting, shift light, accurate tach driving and tell-tale as well as the   certainty that the timing is never likely to &lsquo;go off&rsquo;.<br />
  <br />
              The benefits from   a mapped system have to be experienced to be appreciated. Throttle response is   razor sharp, economy is improved and tractability (especially with more radical   cams) is amazing. In my own experience an engine converted from a centrifugal   advance type of system to a mapped system undergoes a radical   transformation.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="convertignition" id="convertignition"></a><strong class="style6B">Conversion of   ignition from a non-mapped system</strong><br />
              To convert from a normal   distributor-based system to a mapped system is not as difficult as you might   think. In addition to the EMS/mapped ignition unit you will need a throttle   potentiometer to measure throttle angle (and therefore load) which needs to be   attached to your throttle spindle, and a distributor with no advance mechanism,   in place of your existing distributor. Usually most of the existing ignition   system - coil, leads, plugs, distributor cap and rotor arm can be   retained.<br />
  <br />
              As an alternative to replacing the distributor the existing one   can have the advance mechanism locked to ensure that it gives a constant signal   to the EMS. This can be done by drilling through the weights and base plate and   inserting a self-taper or by brazing/&rsquo;MIG&rsquo;ing the advance mechanism   solid.<br />
  <br />
              The EMS will require an electronic signal from the distributor so   a points-based distributor will not do. Most post-1980 engines have electronic   ignition so if your engine doesn't have an electronic distributor it is usually   possible to find a later distributor for your engine, that has a magnetic   reluctor or Hall effect trigger. Some later versions of your engine may well   have a factory-fitted EMS which uses a Hall effect or reluctor-triggered   distributor that may also not have an advance mechanism. If so this is ideal. If   you cannot find a suitable replacement, then a Lumenition eye fitted in place of   the points will do the trick.<br />
  <br />
              The EMS will require some fairly   straightforward wiring in and obviously will require a mapping session on a   rolling road. Most EMS suppliers have example maps available which are &lsquo;safe&rsquo;   and will get you up and running for your trip to the rolling road.</p>
            <p align="justify">If you don't have a map to start with then the   existing curve from your mechanical distributor can be plotted using a timing   light and some patience, and then programmed into the EMS. Adjustments can be   made for part throttle, starting and idle and this should get you   going.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <a name="mapping" id="mapping"></a><strong class="style6B">Engine   Mapping</strong><br />
              Generally mapping of an engine takes place in a   controlled environment where engine temperature and air temperature can be   controlled or at least measured. On after-market systems the mapping is normally   done using a laptop PC which is connected to the EMS via a serial cable.   Software supplied by the EMS manufacturer usually allows re-mapping of the fuel   and ignition requirements with various degrees of flexibility and ease of   use.<br />
  <br />
              The EMS is normally able to relay back to the PC all the relevant   information about the engine telemetry; coolant and air temperature, rpm, load   site, current timing, current fueling, Lambda reading etc. while the engine is   running. For a manufacturer an engine will be installed on a test rig which can   control and monitor the engine's performance and environment exactly. <br />
  <br />
              For an already installed engine, mapping is usually done on a rolling   road which has a &lsquo;pegging&rsquo; facility that can hold the rollers at a fixed speed   regardless of input torque. A rolling road is a set of rollers on which a   vehicle can simulate driving. The rollers are attached to a &lsquo;brake&rsquo; that can   measure the turning force applied to them and the roller speed. Using these two   pieces of information, the power applied to the rollers by the car's driven   wheels can be measured. Generally an engine will produce maximum torque for any   given speed and load when the fueling and timing are at their   optimum.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="mapstart" id="mapstart"></a><strong class="style6B">Starting up</strong><br />
              When there   is no existing map, the first trick is to get the engine started. The ignition   is set to 20 degrees or so at speed sites 0 and 1 at load site 0. Fuel is added   at these sites by increasing the fuel number in the map dynamically as the   engine is cranked until the engine fires. If the engine temperature is very low   then a degree of correction is applied to the map to enable the engine to start.   Once started the engine is allowed to warm up using only the first load and   speed positions.<br />
  <br />
              If the engine starts to die the fueling is altered to   &lsquo;clean up&rsquo; the running. It may be that the throttle and balance need adjusting   for the engine to run. This is generally done before mapping commences. By the   time the engine is hot, the fueling at that load/speed site will be trimmed to   almost correct. This fuel setting can then be used as a basis for all the speed   sites at that particular engine load. This will be sufficient as a starting   point and will allow the engine to run at those engine speeds.<br />
  <br />
              The next   step is to trim the idle fueling and ignition until the idle is at the desired   engine speed and is reasonably clean. This is because mapping involves a lot of   stopping and starting of the engine. If the idle settings are wrong the battery   will be quickly flattened. Quite often the timing at the speed site just above   idle is set to a very low figure which stops the engine from racing when at   idle. If the engine speed rises the timing drops back and causes the speed to   drop again. Similarly at the speed site below idle the timing is set quite high   to &lsquo;kick&rsquo; the engine if the idle speed drops. Once this is done the mapping can   start in earnest.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="mapprocess" id="mapprocess"></a><strong class="style6B">The mapping   process</strong><br />
              The rolling road is set to hold at a particular rpm by   driving the car on the rollers in a high gear until that rpm is reached, and   then &lsquo;<strong>pegging</strong>&rsquo; the rollers. By applying the throttle the operator can   hold the engine against the rollers pegged position so that the engine speed and   throttle position is constant. At this point the fueling is adjusted until the   Lambda reading indicates that the mixture is <strong>stichomythic</strong> (chemically   correct).<br />
  <br />
              If at any stage during this adjustment, pinking is heard then   the operator will back off the timing. Then the operator will adjust the timing   until the rollers indicate maximum torque while he listens carefully for   pinking. If the torque starts to fall or the operator can hear pinking then the   engine is over-advanced and he will retard the timing.<br />
  <br />
              At the point of   maximum torque the operator will back off the timing until just before torque   starts to fall. This means the engine will be set at the minimum advance for   maximum efficiency or <strong>minimum best timing</strong>.<br />
  <br />
              Use of this technique   minimizes the possibility of pinking or detonation in operation. Once a   particular engine speed and load site has been mapped in this way the fueling   and ignition values can be extrapolated to all successive speed sites for this   particular engine load as a starting point. Even though these will not be   correct they will be near enough to allow the engine to run. The operator will   then continue for every load site at this engine speed.<br />
  <br />
              This process is   repeated for each successive speed and load site (or at least those which can be   reached) until the mapping process is complete. Once the overall mapping is   done, attention can be paid to the adjustments or corrections to the map, namely   cranking, acceleration/deceleration fueling and cold start adjustment. The most   difficult of these to gauge is the cold-start adjustment since the engine will   now be stinking hot. Often the owner will need to adjust these to give the best   starting although the operator can usually supply some reasonable estimates for   the cold start adjustment. It is important to make sure that the maps which have   just been constructed are saved onto the hard disk. It is the operator&rsquo;s   responsibility to make sure that the map is extracted from the EMS and then   saved.<br />
  <br />
              It is during this mapping that the quality of the software has a   part to play - ease of use and intuitive display of information is critical if   the mapping is to proceed safely and in a timely manner.<br />
  <br />
              When the engine   has been mapped it is quite interesting to examine the maps. Normally the map   information (after a little massaging) can be imported into Excel or a similar   graphing program and plotted as a surface contour. Some EMS (such as the Emerald   M3D and GEMS system) have a graphical display built in to allow the maps to be   viewed as a surface contour or wire-frame graph. Visualizing the maps in this   way gives a much better and clearer picture of the engine's fuel requirements   and helps to iron out any &lsquo;glitches&rsquo; in the maps.<br />
  <br />
              Generally fuel values   are very small on part throttle and grow considerably when the throttle is   opened (since more air is inducted to the engine). The peaks on the fuel map are   usually where the peaks in the torque curve are and in most cases fuel drops off   above peak torque even though horsepower may be rising. This is because cylinder   filling or <strong>Volumetric Efficiency</strong> is lower past peak torque. Although the   engine is consuming more fuel, it is using less per revolution since it   consuming less air per revolution.<br />
  <br />
              Often the operator will provide a   no-fuel position at the maximum load site at speed site zero. This is provided   to clear out a flooded engine. Then to clear the engine of fuel it is necessary   to open the throttle to its maximum and then crank. Since cold start and   cranking fueling adjustments are percentage corrections to the fuel map, when   applied to a zero fuel setting they will also be zero.<br />
  <br />
              Ignition timing   maps look rather different. At part throttle ignition timing is generally much   higher, often reaching more than 45 degrees since partially full cylinders burn   much more slowly and require more advance. It is this part throttle mapping   which is critical to the flexibility of the engine, especially when off-cam.   Around idle the timing numbers will be quite large to sustain a rock-steady idle   and will fall back rapidly above idle to stop the engine from racing. Peak   timing at wide open throttle is normally reached at around 3500-4000rpm and   depending on engine type a further small increase may be required above   7500rpm.<br />

  <a name="convertinj" id="convertinj"></a><strong class="style6B">Conversion to throttle   bodies/EMS from carbs or plenum</strong><br />
              Conversion of an existing   carburetor or plenum-based installation to throttle body injection is   relatively straightforward provided that you fully understand what is required   for the installation. If you are replacing carbs then you will need the   following parts:</p>
            <p align="justify">An EMS<br />
              A baffled fuel tank<br />
              A high-pressure   injection fuel pump<br />
              A fuel pressure regulator<br />
              Some injectors of the right   capacity<br />
              The appropriate &lsquo;snap-on&rsquo; connectors for the injectors' wiring<br />
              A   configuration of throttle bodies (optionally with manifold)<br />

              A fuel rail (often included with the   throttle bodies)<br />
              Air horns and air filter<br />
              Plenty of high-pressure rubber   fuel hose and clips<br />
              Some 8mm fuel pipe<br />
              Patience and a sense of   humor.<br />
  <br />
              If you are converting from an existing plenum-based injection   system, then you may not need to convert your fuel tank and can usually retain   the fuel pump, injectors, fuel rail and pressure regulator. Quite often the   throttle pot and coolant sensor are also re-usable especially with   plug-compatible EMS replacements.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="tank" id="tank"></a><strong class="style6B">Fuel   Tank</strong><U><br />
  </U> The main factor to consider when converting from   carburetors to injection is the fuel delivery system. The fuel tank is the   first link in the fuel delivery chain. A normal un-baffled fuel tank is not   suitable for an injected engine since under the influence of the various &lsquo;G&rsquo;   forces encountered in a moving vehicle, the fuel can move away from the tank   pick-up and cause the fuel pump to suck air. With a carburetor-based system the   carb has a float chamber from which the fuel can be drawn if the pump supply   dries up. An injection system on the other hand has no such reservoir. If the   supply of fuel to the pump dries up then the engine will cut out due to lack of   fuel. This is exacerbated by the fact that the fuel pump runs all the time with   an injection system, with surplus fuel being diverted back to the tank via the   pressure regulator.<br />
  <br />
              There are two ways of counteracting this fuel   starvation. One way is to compartmentalize the tank, i.e. build a compartment   around the pump's outlet which is fluid-tight and use one-way valves that allow   fuel in to the compartment but not out again. This keeps the fuel in the area of   the pump outlet, which also can be supplemented by fitting a small conventional   auxiliary pump that can shunt fuel from the opposite end of the tank to   counteract the effects of fuel-surge. The other way is to use a fuel reservoir   or surge-pot that holds a liter or so of fuel, and supplies the pump regardless   of the fuel situation in the tank. This is fed by a small pump from the tank or   by gravity, and is sufficient for several seconds of engine activity. Ensuring   that the fuel returned from the pressure regulator is directed at the pump   outlet can also minimize the effects of surge in the fuel tank.<br />

              You <strong>cannot</strong> convert to injection and not pay attention to your fuel tank - it   absolutely must be baffled and compartmentalized, or fitted with a   surge-pot.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="pump" id="pump"></a><strong class="style6B">Fuel Pump, lines and   regulator</strong><br />
              An injection fuel pump is very different to a   conventional fuel pump used to supply carburetors. Firstly it runs all the time   and does not &lsquo;stall&rsquo; as a conventional pump does when the float chambers are   full. It also supplies fuel at a much higher pressure than a normal pump at   around 80-100psi compared with 5-6psi. It is also essential that the pump be fed   by gravity, since an injection pump is designed as a &lsquo;blow&rsquo; pump rather than a   &lsquo;suck&rsquo; pump. The requirement to gravity feed the pump normally means that it has   to be mounted underneath and adjacent to the fuel tank, so a fused power supply   is required to be run into that area. Since the fuel is continuously delivered   and returned to the tank, two fuel pipes are required - a supply pipe and a   return pipe. Normally the existing fuel line can be used as the return pipe with   a new line laid in for the supply. When plumbing in the pump it is absolutely   essential that high-pressure fuel pipe is used. Normal rubber hose will not do.   It will burst and cause a fire hazard. Ensure that you only use properly rated   hose capable of withstanding in excess of 60psi. The inlet to the pump is   normally 12mm internal size, so the spur from the tank must be this size also.   The remainder of the fuel pipe can be 8mm copper or steel tubing. Ensure that   the ends of the tube are &lsquo;flared&rsquo; to help the integrity of any   joins.<br />
  <br />
              Injection pumps are noisy so make sure that you mount your pump in   a cradle of some kind suspended by rubber cotton reels or wrap it in some sound   deadening material before mounting. Don&rsquo;t take chances with the pump - it must   be properly insulated and leak free.<br />
  <br />
              Injection pumps require that the   fuel be filtered before it reaches the pump. In some cases this is not easy to   arrange. However any dirt or rubbish entering the pump can and will cause it to   lock solid and render it permanently inoperable or damaged. Where space is   limited, a fine wire-mesh screen can be used in the inlet to the pump provided   that it is fitted in such a way that it cannot enter the pump. This will screen   any reasonably sized particles. If you are using this method ensure you   clean/change the screen regularly and fit a proper fuel filter following the   pump.<br />
  <br />
              There are plenty of injection pumps to be found in the scrap yards -   most vehicles post-1989 are fitted with injection systems and are a good source   of pumps and injectors. If you select a vehicle with a suitably sized engine   then the pump should be up to the job. It's likely that the injectors won't be   far out either. It is quite possible that the fuel pressure regulator might be   suitable assuming that it is not integrated with the fuel rail. My pump   injectors and pressure regulator came from a broken Sierra Cosworth.   Alternatively you can source the pump from a motor factor or specialized   supplier.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="induct" id="induct"></a><strong class="style6B">Induction system</strong><br />
              If you   already have twin Weber's or Dellorto's fitted to your engine then the obvious   choice of induction system is a flange compatible throttle body kit such as the   TB throttle bodies from Jenvey. These will bolt on directly in place of the   similar styled DCOE's or DHLA's. If you have IDA or IDF Weber's then the TF bodies   are flange compatible. If your engine is not already equipped with dual   side draught/down draught carbs then you must make the appropriate selection of   either dual or single throttle bodies with an appropriate manifold and air   horns/filters. I have had some success having back-plates made to take the dual   ITG filter on the end of a set of air horns attached to either dual or single   throttle bodies. This makes a nice neat installation. If you are using the parts   retained from a carburetor set-up then you can re-use the filters and   back-plates. If you cannot obtain a suitable manifold for your engine then it is   possible to fabricate one.<br />
  <br />
              Some throttle bodies will bolt directly to the   cylinder head notably some of the range produced by Jenvey.<br />
  <br />
              If you are   upgrading from a plenum based system then you may find that you can re-use the   fuel rail, injectors, pressure regulator and throttle position sensor. This will   save money and aggravation. Some ingenuity may be required in the fabrication of   brackets to attach the OEM components to the new throttle bodies but it is not a   difficult task.<br />
  <br />
              When buying the throttle bodies you must also purchase a   throttle linkage since the type used on twin side draught carburetors is not   suitable and cannot be used. Generally throttle body kits come complete with   fuel rails that are designed to take the standard Bosch type of   injector.<br />
  <br />
              Air horns are generally necessary and the main limiting factor   for length is the space available on the inlet side of the engine. Measure   carefully here to ensure that what you are buying will fit.<br />
  <br />
              The throttle   potentiometer is normally fitted to the end of the spindle on one of the   throttle bodies, ensure that it is fitted so that it is opening and not closing,   e.g. against the spring tension.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="plumb" id="plumb"></a><strong class="style6B">Plumbing   in</strong><br />
              After running the fuel line as close as possible to the end of   the fuel rail, the plumbing in is a simple task. If you are retaining an   existing fuel rail arrangement then it should simply be a matter of bolting on   the rail and connecting as before. When fitting a new rail it is important to   ensure that the injectors are properly clipped to the rail and that the rail   when fitted holds the injectors firmly into their position in the inlet manifold   or throttle body pockets. The fuel supply should be connected to one end of the   fuel rail with the pressure regulator connected to the other. The outlet of the   pressure regulator is then connected to the fuel tank return pipe. The return   pipe should dump its fuel as close as possible to the pump outlet in the   tank.<br />
  <br />
  <a name="wiring" id="wiring"></a><strong class="style6B">Wiring</strong><br />
              Generally the only   things to connect are the fuel pump which requires a fused supply that is   switched by the ignition, the throttle potentiometer which is connected to the   EMS, the coolant and air temperature senders that are again connected to the EMS   and the injectors themselves. Finding a place for the coolant temperature sender   is not always easy but often it is possible to drill and tap an existing boss   somewhere on the engine which must be the engine side of the thermostat,   preferably in the head. The air temperature sender should be mounted as near to   the inlet trumpets as possible.<br />
  <br />
              Depending on the type of injection -   batched, grouped or sequential, the injectors may be wired in parallel or in   series. Follow the instructions which come with the EMS to make sure that you do   this correctly. If you need the snap-on connectors for the injectors, a trip to   the scrap yard is called for. Make sure you get plenty of wire with the   connectors and while you are there look for the connectors which clip on to the   coolant temperature sender as well.<br />
  <br />
              It is a good idea to bolt the   throttle bodies to a dummy manifold (a piece of angle iron suitably drilled with   a few correctly spaced holes will do) in order to make the injector loom and fit   and adapt the throttle linkage and other ancillaries. Doing this while the   bodies are not attached to the car is much more convenient as it makes the   set-up more accessible. Any problems that arise with linkages, air horns, wiring   etc. can be much more easily solved. Depending on resistance some injectors will   need a resistor in series in order for the EMS to fire them correctly. Ensure   that this is mounted and connected correctly.<br />
  <br />
              When this has all been   fitted satisfactorily, all that remains is to power on the pump and ensure that   it is circulating fuel before starting the mapping process.

  <br />
            Note the relatively high advance at idle   which is used to give a rock-steady tick-over and the dip in timing following   the idle position which causes the engine to dip back if the idle gets too fast.   Note also the extra advance on part throttle throughout the range and the small   dip in the timing at 3500rpm where, although the rpm is higher, the timing is   less than at 2500 and 3000rpm.</p>

              It is clear to see where peak torque is on the engine from the injection map.   The large bump on the fuel map is at 6500rpm. This is where cylinder filling is   best and therefore is the point of maximum fueling and maximum torque.<br />
