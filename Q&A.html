                  <br />
 If your just looking for cheap power, a V8 swap is probably  the best way to go. But if your tired of cookie cutter V8s and your looking for something  different,   a performance six may be just the ticket. If you like tinkering on engines  and have plenty of patience, and you like a challenge, re-building an inline six can be a very rewarding experience. Especially when it's done properly. <br /> 
<br />
By design, inline sixes  produce more pavement pounding torque, pound for pound, than their V8 counterparts, and they usually get  better gas mileage. They also  offer improved  handling  and braking, due to the reduced nose weight.       They're  fun to drive, easy to work on, very reliable, and a performance six will usually attract more attention at car shows.   Simply put, they're awesome motors. <br />
<br />
                  However there are a few things you need to consider before making your decision. First, you need to understand that building a performance six cylinder engine is going to set you back a few  bucks. A performance six  can drain your pocketbook quickly  if you haven't done your homework. Depending on your goals, your personal experience, and how much of the work you can do yourself,  a performance six will generally cost twice a much to build, as compared to a small block V8. Especially if you have to rely on someone else to do all the work for you.<br />
                <br /> 
                Selecting the right combination of parts is crucial, but  selecting the right shop is just as important, if not more so. Even if they do great work on V8s, the results can be  disappointing (or worse) if they've never built a six. I can't tell you how many times I've heard stories about shops and engine builders who don't bother to check the compression ratio or degree the cam. Bottom line, they simply  don't think it's going to make a difference. After all, &quot;it's only a six&quot;.  
                </p>
                  <p align="justify" class="style3B">Make certain your shop is &quot;concerned&quot; with what they are doing, and whenever possible, that  they have experience building inline sixes. If they don't seem interested in your project,  do yourself a big favor and walk away. Be especially cautious of those who keep reminding you that they're &quot;experts&quot;, or that  they've built numerous  Award Winning V8's, and that  a six isn't any different. IT IS! Never hire a shop that doesn't care. Find one that likes the challenge of building a six,  because <strong><em>it is</em></strong> different. Find a shop that's excited about doing the work, one that looks forward to  seeing the end results. If they don't have experience, make sure they  do their homework. <br />
                    <br />
                    Before you start ordering parts and/or turning wrenches, take time to visit our tech section and read the recommended <a href="Magazines.html">magazine</a> and <a href="Tech.html">tech</a> articles. Spend time searching through <a href="www.fordsix.html">forum</a> topics, and  purchase the <a href="proddetail733c.html?prod=FSP%2D200%2DFSH">Falcon Six Handbook</a>.   The more prepared you are, the more successful you'll be. Once you have a good idea of your goals (keep it realistic), make  a  plan  and establish a budget. While you need to be flexible, you also need to stick to your plan, and your budget,   as much as possible.  Then, as one of our forum members puts it, <span class="style4B">&quot;Enjoy the Journey&quot;</span>. <br />

                    <br />
                    <span class="style3B">We ran a poll on the FordSix forum, asking members why they rebuilt their inline  six, rather than swapping to a V8. As you can clearly see, the primary reason was to be different. Most  of us are tired of seeing  the same    hopped up small block V8's (what  we call &quot;Cookie Cutter V8's&quot;) when we go to  car shows. Most of us prefer to do   something different, something unusual, something out of the norm. And a hopped up six  is exactly that. However there are those who simply want the best  mileage they can get, or  those who just want to increase the power of their existing motors, without going through the hassles of swapping to a V8, and that's fine too.  Either way, no matter the reason, Classic Inlines and FordSix are here to help. </span></p>

                    This is a question I hear everyday, sometimes several times   a day, over the phone and by e-mail. It has also been posted in the fordsix forum (and answered) many times over. To answer such a vague question,  is  time consuming and difficult. There are simply to many questions that need to be answered first, at least before anyone can reply with a educated answer. For us old timers, seeing the same question posted over and over can be annoying, so you may get a short answer, or  what seems to be a  rude reply. If so, please try to understand why. When you ask a vague or generic question, you'll usually get a vague or generic answer in return. You'd be much better off doing some homework first, before you start asking questions. Try to establish a basic plan, and   a budget, and when you do ask a question,  try to be  specific.  </span></p>

                    You don't need a lot of money to get started,  but in general   you'll find it  cost considerably more to build a performance six, vrs a V8. Much of the cost depends   on your experience level, or how much of the work you can do yourself. If you have to pay a shop to do everything,  you can easily wind up  spending more of your hard earned dollars for  labor, rather than parts.  Look for a shop that has   experience building sixes, preferably with customer referrals. The worst situation is to wind up paying   a shop to experiment with your engine, only to end up with a motor that doesn't run properly. And this happens more often than you might think, even when the shop comes highly recommended by your buddy with the V8.  Be especially weary of the so called &quot;Award Winning&quot; shops, or the &quot;Experts&quot;. Most don't have a clue when it comes to building a six. Looks for shops that are eager to work with you, and those that like the challenge of building a six, because it is different. <br />

                    Most backyard (or DIY) mechanics can handle headers, ignition upgrades, and carb swaps without any problems, however they may need help  jetting the carb and  tuning the engine for the best performance. One of the most beneficial modifications, is upgrading the cam. Therefore, if a valve job or  cylinder head swap is planned, make the most of it by  swapping out the cam while the head is off. Unlike a V8, the cylinder head must be removed to swap out the cam (to remove the lifters).  While your at it, install larger valves, and  have the head professionally ported for improved air flow. When you swap the cam, or even if you use a stock cam profile, make sure you upgrade the valve springs and pushrods.  Don't even think about using stock springs, as they will float around 4500 rpm, and that's when they are new.</span> If your using a stock cam or a mild performance cam, 302 springs work great for the average street motor. <br />

                </span><br />
Not only is the answer &quot;yes&quot;, as long as you verify the compression ratio, it is actually one of the best ways to increase the performance of the 200ci six.   While all 144,170, 200, &amp; 250ci cylinder heads are interchangeable,  the     valve size, chamber size (cc's), and intake tract volume, changed over the years.  And while all small six   cylinder heads  are interchangeable, and will  physically bolt on and function,  it is very important to  verify the  compression ratio and adjust the size of the combustion chambers based on the specific needs of your motor.  Combustion chambers that are too large decrease the compression ratio, there-by reducing  throttle response and over all performance. However this  is easily corrected  by milling the head and/or installing a thinner head gasket.  On the other hand, a smaller combustion chamber  increases the compression ratio, which in turn increases throttle response and  overall performance.  However,   be carefully you don't  go to far. To much compression causes <a href="Detonation.html">detonation</a> and/or <a href="Detonation.html">pre-ignition</a>, which  leads to catastrophic engine failures in  very short order. Ideally, the compression ratio should be around 9:1 to 9.5:1 with a cast iron cylinder head. <br />

The most common mistake when swapping carbs, is to over-carb the motor (installing a carb that is too big for the motor). When in doubt use a smaller carb,  bigger is not better. For stock or mild performance engines, we recommend the   Vaporizer 1V, or the 32/36 Weber DGV, which is a progressive 2V carb. For performance motors,  we  recommend any of the Autolite 2V's, which range  from 240cfm up to 356cfm,  the Holley 350cfm or  500cfm, or the 38/38 Weber. </span></p>

                    However the &quot;Load-O-Matic&quot; distributor   was designed for  simplicity and economy,  which makes  them  a poor  choice for the performance enthusiast.  &quot;Load-O-Matic&quot; distributors have no provision for mechanical advance, instead they rely  solely on a relatively weak vacuum signal to sense changes in load and speed (rpm), which was provided by the infamous Spark Control Valve. Not only is it important to know how the Spark Control Valve works,  it is very important to know how it  work in conjunction with the Load-O-Matic distributor, especially if your planning a carb swap.</span></strong><strong><span class="style3B"><br />

                </a>This has been debated numerous times in the FordSix forum, however it seems most members would agree that the best bang for the buck, or the first modification to do, would be up-grading  the ignition system. Toss the old points style distributor in favor of a  electronic or magnetic reluctor style distributor. Either will result in quicker starts, smoother idle, improved throttle response, and will usually eliminate  flat spots when the system is properly tuned and timed.

                    There are numerous advantages to swapping out your old stock points style distributor for an electronic ignition system. In our opinion, regardless if you have a stock motor or a high performance rebuild,  it's the  &quot;Best Bang for the Buck&quot;.
                    Basically you have three choices, a Petronics, a Duraspark, or the DUI. While the Petronics and DUI are pretty straight forward, the Duraspark has several options for an ignition source, which we explain  in our tech article. Each system has a unique advantages over the other two. As such, it may be more desirable to install one system, as opposed to the other two, to  better suit your needs. However, with so many choices available, it's difficult to know which system to choose. As such, we decided to compile the  information in a tech article so you can make an informed decision when the time comes. <br />

We believe it's more like 5-10%.

This question has  been debated several times in the Ford Six forum. The general consensus among forum members is that port dividers are not needed and do little to assist performance. To our knowledge there are no dyno test to prove otherwise. The only thing known for sure, is that the make a horrendous rattle when they break loose, due to poor or improper installation. Several members have installed the port dividers, only to remove them to stop the rattling. Once removed, they can tell no difference in performance, based on seat of the pants testing. They may however assist in preventing blown head gaskets, but this too is unknown for sure. The only recommendation we will make, is to follow the directions to the letter when installing one. Don't take short cuts and make sure they are welded in place (no JB Weld). <br />

                    <br />
The term &quot;Degreeing In Your Camshaft&quot; means   you are making sure the camshaft's position in the engine coincides with that of   the crankshaft, so that their rotation is synchronized. This is the only way you   will know if the rise and fall of the pistons properly matches the opening and   closing of the valves, so the engine will run properly. A few degrees of   misalignment can affect the engine's operation dramatically. <br />
<br />
If the   circumstances were perfect, one would only need to line up the marks on the   timing chain sprockets and the cam would be degreed. In reality, you are dealing   with a group of components (the camshaft, crankshaft, timing chain, and   sprockets), all with their own standards and tolerances. These tolerances   stack up against you and can throw your camshaft out of adjustment. Without degreeing the   cam you can never be sure that the parts are in correct position. If you have   the tools, we always recommend that the camshaft's position in the   engine be degreed in. If you don't have the tools, borrow or purchase them. <br />
<br />
<span class="style3Bl"><strong>NOTE:</strong> It should be noted that all Clay Smith Cams are ground straight up, whereas most  cam manufactures automatically grind their cams with four degrees of advance. As such, when installing and degreeing your  Clay Smith Cam, we highly recommend adding four degrees of advance for optimum performance. </span><br />

                </strong><br />
                <span style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0;">Valve springs are one of the most critical components of your engine. It is very important to match the camshaft and potential RPM range with the correct  spring rate.&nbsp;You may have heard that <strong class="style3B">too much spring pressure is hard on valves.</strong> In truth, it's the speed  of the valve as  it contacts the valve seat when closing. What dictates how hard   the valve hits the seat? It&rsquo;s supposed to be the camshaft closing ramp, or the shape of the cam lobe. However when   spring pressures are too low, the lifter will begin to float as rpm's are increased,  causing the valve to  slam into the seat. In some cases the valve will  actually bounce once or twice, before fully closing. As such higher spring   pressures aid the valve, by forcing the lifter to  follow the shape of the cam lobe more closely. On the other hand,  to much  spring pressure adds to friction and valve train wear and tear. Therefore it is important to follow the manufacturers recommendations, matching the spring pressure to the cam profile and the desired rpm range. </span><br />

                      </strong></span><br />
                    A T5 swap is  one of the best modifications you can do as it offers many advantages over the stock three speed transmission. First, the lower first gear transfers more bottom end power to the rear wheels  to get your car moving easier and quicker. 
                    Next, the overdrive feature, or fifth gear, provides    exceptional fuel savings and greatly reduces engine  RPM's during highway use, which extends the life of the engine and it's accessories. Cruising will also be more   pleasurable, as cabin noise is substantially reduced. Finally, you'll never   have to watch the competition blow past you on the highway because you're out of   RPM! </p>
                  <p>If your thinking about upgrading to a T5, contact  Modern   Driveline. They have a complete range of products and options  for adding a five speed behind your inline six.     Many   different clutch configurations are available, depending on driving style and   power level, as well as bell housings, transmissions, and driveshafts.&nbsp;<br />
