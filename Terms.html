            <div align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Acceptance of Terms</span><br />
  No signatures are required as the placing of an   order indicates you accept and understand  these terms and conditions. Please read them   carefully and print a
              copy for  future reference in the event they are needed. Please refer to  our <strong>Ordering, Warranty, Shipping, and Return</strong> pages for more detailed information regarding our  policies as the information contained therein is  considered to be a part of our terms and conditions as a  whole.  If  International shipping is intended, please read our <strong>International Shipping</strong> policies. <br />
              <br />
              <span class="style6B">General Terms and Conditions</span><br />
              The following   terms and conditions apply to all transactions from Classic Inlines. The placing of an   order indicates your acceptance of these terms and conditions. Please read them   carefully and print a copy for future reference. These terms and   conditions do not affect your statutory rights. To order goods through this   web site you must be 
              at least 18 years of age. We will treat each order for goods   as an offer by you to purchase the goods subject to these terms and   conditions. It is only when we have shipped the products to you, that we have a binding contract. Classic Inlines has the right   to refuse, at our discretion, to supply any goods ordered by   you.  </div>
            <p align="justify" class="style3B"> <span class="style6B">Typographical Errors</span><br />
    In the event that   a product is listed at an incorrect price due to a typographical error, or an error   in pricing  from 
      our suppliers, Classic Inlines shall have the right to refuse or   cancel any orders based on the incorrect price at 
      any time. While we   endeavor to ensure all prices, images, and specifications are correct, Classic Inlines accepts 
      no responsibility for incorrect   images or  typographical errors. If however you spot a mistake with a   products price, description and/or specification, please let us know.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Forms of Payment</span><br />
  We accept&nbsp;credit   cards, cashiers checks, and money orders. On the order form, you must provide us with   your exact address and telephone number which matches what   your credit card issuer has on file. Your order will only 
      be processed once authorization of your credit   card is approved, or when the cashiers check or money order has been successfully received and deposited. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Availability of Products</span> <br />
    All products are   subject to availability and may be withdrawn or backordered at any time. However it is our   policy to contact you if a product is out of stock. If you do not wish to   proceed with the order or for any reason, or if we cannot supply the product within a reasonable amount of time,  the order will be cancelled and monies refunded in full. We offer an   extended range of products, which are obtained directly from our suppliers, therefore these   products are subject to the supplier's stock and delivery dates. It is our policy to contact you to explain   the stock and delivery situation if a product is backordered, hence it is important for all orders to contain accurate email addresses and phone numbers so we can contact you. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Damages in Transit</span><br />
  As internal   damage cannot always be identified on delivery, the customer must sign the   drivers manifest as &quot;unchecked&quot;. Should any damage be identified upon opening of the   package, the shipping company must be notified within 24 hours  of the exact damage. It is   imperative that the customer does not dispose of any of the packaging, as this   will be required to affect a claim against the carrier. Al claims are the responsibility of the customer and  arrangement for settlement is the customer responsibility. Classic Inlines shall not be held responsible or liable under any circumstance. Classic Inlines will not ship replacement parts until said claims have been settled and/or additional payments are made to Classic Inlines for the lost or damage products. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Shortages and Incorrect Goods</span> <br />
    Should the   package  be missing an item, or if the wrong product is believed, the Customer must notify Classic Inlines within 24 hours of  delivery via e-mail or phone. The matter   will be investigated and the customer will be informed of our decision. It is usually easy to verify if all products have been shipped, as we utilize a shipping invoice which is checked off as items are packed. However, occasionally we do make mistakes. If the items are not as ordered, the customer must not open   the manufacturers packaging or use the item. The product must be returned in the original packaging in good and unused condition. The correct products will not be ship until the return products have been received and inspected.  Shipping cost to return said products will be covered by Classic Inlines and the customer will be reimbursed once  the returned product has been received.  Should   there be any extenuating circumstances that has prohibited the the Customer to   remain within the specified time frames, or any issues stated herein, resolution will be by mutual   decision. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Mis-Ordered Products</span><br />
  If you happen to order the wrong product(s) in error, you may return it with written authorization,  within 7 days from   the date of receivable.  A full refund will be extended, providing it is in pristine condition, and is in its   original box and/or packaging. The goods must be returned &quot;as new&quot;   or in the same condition that they were received in. There can   be no damage,   and all related parts need to be returned, along with the original packaging. We do   not refund shipping  charges applied to the initial order, or pay    the cost of returning said item(s). Only complete, undamaged, unused products will be accepted.  Adequate packaging must be used to   return the goods, as they must be received in good condition. Adequate   packaging constitutes that the item is wrapped securely and then placed inside a   box and returned to Classic Inlines  with no internal damage.   If the package arrives with external damage, it may be returned  freight COD. Items that are not securely wrapped and received, will be returned in the same   manner, freight COD. Classic Inlines reserves the   right to reject any item(s) that do not meet the criteria above. A restocking fee   of up to 25% of the original invoice value may be levied on the product(s)   returned, if accepted in a damaged or used condition. Products  are not sold on a trial basis, and it is the customers responsibility to   establish the suitability of the goods for your intended   purpose. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Warranty &amp; Faulty Goods</span><br />
    In most cases, all warranties are limited to the original manufacturers warranty.    If you think that   the product you have purchased is faulty we may refer you to the manufacturer,   due to their extensive knowledge of their product. If the original manufacturer agrees   that the product is faulty, in most cases they will be able to authorize a   replacement or repair of the product.   A restocking fee   may be imposed on returns which prove to be non-defective. It is   therefore imperative that you have made contact with the manufacturer prior to returning the product. In some instances, you may be required to return the product directly to the original manufacturer. Restocking fee's are non-negotiable. For more details on our warranty policy, please refer to our Warranty page.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Cancellations and Returns </span><br />
    Orders cancelled   after shipment of the goods will be subject to credit only after the items have been    returned. If the items are accepted,   opened and used the Distance Selling Regulations will apply. In all instances,   the goods must be returned as new, with no blemish, defect or  missing parts. Neither   must the outer manufacturer packaging show any damage or be defaced in anyway.   Should the items and/or packaging show any damage or be incomplete and defaced in any   manner, a 25% fee will apply, which  will automatically be deducted from the credit   issued. For more information see Returns. Orders cancelled prior to shipment will be refunded in full, with the exception of special order parts. In such cases, Classic Inlines reserves the right to withhold 5% as a stocking and/or handling fee. If payment was made via Paypal, a 3.5% fee will be withheld from the refund after 60 days for all returns and/or cancellations, as this fee is non-refundable to Classic Inlines. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Refunds</span><br />
    If for any reason   you are issued with a refund, please note the following. Credit card  refunds will be issued to the   same payment method as on the original order. A refund will usually reach your   credit card account within 4 working days after it being processed, please allow   up to 10 working days for it to be credited. We do however reserve the right to   refund you within 30 days of the return. </p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Shipping Policies</span> <br />
    While every reasonable effort shall be made to keep  estimated delivery dates, the time of delivery shall not be of the essence of the order. We normally use a 48 hour window for most orders, however due to reason beyond our control and the demand on some products this can extend,  therefore recommend you allow up to 7-10 working days for shipment. In such cases, Classic Inlines will attempt to contact the customer and extend notification. Classic Inlines shall not be liable for any losses, costs, damages or expenses incurred by the customer, or any other person or company, arising directly or indirectly out of failure to meet any estimated delivery date including UPS 3 Day Select orders. Unless otherwise agreed we may deliver backordered products as they become available. Additional shipping cost for backordered product deliveries will be the responsibility of Classic Inlines unless otherwise notified. Failure by the Customer to pay for any shipping cost incurred on his part, when due,  shall entitle Classic Inlines to withhold further deliveries. Delivery of the goods shall be made to the customer's shipping address. The customer shall make any and all arrangements necessary to accept  delivery of the goods, and any cost incurred for the return of unaccepted products shall be the liability and responsibility of the customer. Please visit the Continental USA and/or International shipping sections for more specific details. </p>

<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Derivability</span><br />

These Terms and   Condition shall be construed in accordance with English Law.</p>
<p align="justify" class="style3B"><span class="style6B">Force   Majeure</span><br />
